As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.
:::

Mobile Kiosk is yet another way for your clients to ask for customer feedback. With this tool, businesses can collect customer information and ask for a review at the most opportune time: while the customer is visiting the business.

Businesses can use the Mobile Kiosk while the customer is in the office, store, or at the job site, such as receiving home services from a plumber. The customer information will automatically be collected in Customer Voice and they will receive a request to review the business.

### How does Mobile Kiosk work?

A traditional review kiosk asks the customer to submit their review on a 3rd party site, like Google or Facebook, while connected to the Wi-Fi network at the business. An influx of reviews coming from the same IP address will be flagged by the review site, which could result in reviews being taken down.

Our Mobile Kiosk helps businesses reap all the rewards of a traditional kiosk without the risk of having their reviews flagged. Here's how!

Simply copy the unique URL from Customer Voice to the clipboard and bookmark the page on a computer, iPad, or tablet at the business, or on the mobile phones of sales or service people. There is no login to Business App or Customer Voice required to view this URL. At the point of sale with the customer or at the end of service, guide them to submit their information (name, email, and/or phone number). Customer Voice will automatically send a review request to that customer and add their information to the Customer List.
