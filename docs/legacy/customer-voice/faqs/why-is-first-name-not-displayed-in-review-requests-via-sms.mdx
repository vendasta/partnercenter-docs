*Note: As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.*

If a customer receives a review request via SMS without having their name displayed, this may be why:

The default templates have a dynamic component to display the '**first name**' of the customer in the SMS, however, the **first name** will be dropped if the allowable character limit is exceeded.

Here is how to ensure that the **first name** is displayed in the SMS:

- Use the "shortened business name," as the business name is the first thing displayed in the SMS, moreover, it takes away from the character limit.
- Edit the SMS message; keep it short and sweet in the message, to free up some characters for the **first name**.

**Note**: The system displays the number of characters available in real-time. When you change anything, it'll tell you when the first name will be dropped.
