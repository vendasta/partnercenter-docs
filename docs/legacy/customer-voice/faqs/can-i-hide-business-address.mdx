:::caution Legacy Product
As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.
:::

The business address mandated by the product - Customer Voice, is in adherence to the CAN-SPAM Laws. It is a legal requirement under the [CAN-SPAM Act of 2003](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/fines-and-penalties-for-spam-email-3515353), enacted in 2004, that if your email is a solicitation, that fact must be clearly communicated, along with who you are and what you are soliciting. In 2019, the Federal Trade Commission completed its [first review of the CAN-SPAM Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/02/ftc-completes-review-can-spam-rule), which favored keeping the Rule, as it "benefits consumers and does not impose substantial economic burdens."

In all unsolicited emails, [CAN-SPAM](https://www.fcc.gov/general/can-spam) requires you to include a physical address and contact information for your business (including service area businesses) so it is not possible to remove the address.
