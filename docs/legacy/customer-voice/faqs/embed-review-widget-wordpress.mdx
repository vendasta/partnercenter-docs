If you have a WordPress site you would like to place the Review Generation widget on, follow the below steps:

## 1. Get the Widget code

- Access Customer Voice.
- Click the **Tools** tab > **Widgets**.
- Copy the **Widget Code**.

Here you'll find the **Review Generation** and the **Review Display** widgets. You can adjust colors, preview the widgets, and copy the code for adding to your website.

## 2. Adding the widget to a WordPress page or post

- Log into your WordPress site
- Navigate to the post or page you want to add the code to (if the page already exists then go to that page)
- Set the WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) editor to "Text" mode (it won't copy in properly if pasted in on Visual mode)
- Paste the widget code into the editor
- Save, preview, or publish your page to see your work

**Note:** Make sure you use "Text" mode. You can adjust the "width" and sometimes a "height" option on these widgets.
