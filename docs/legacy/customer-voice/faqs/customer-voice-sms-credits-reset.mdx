:::

SMS credits reset on the **1st of each month**, as they are tied to our third-party SMS system's renewal; not the date of the add-on renewal.

For example, if you activate 100 SMS credits on April 16th, your balance of SMS credits used will reset to 0/100 on May 1st. This applies to each SMS add-on, regardless of the region.
