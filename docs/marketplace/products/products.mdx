# Marketplace Products

The Marketplace is a library of products and services that you can resell to your business clients. This article explains how Marketplace products work and how to manage them.

## Product listings in Marketplace

When you see products in the Marketplace, you can view additional details for each one by clicking **Learn More**. The following details will always be included in the product details:

- Screenshots of the product
- Descriptions
- Features
- Pricing
- Resources, such as one-pagers, videos, user guides, etc.

## Setting your retail price

For each product that you [are permissioned to sell](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005085873), you can set your own retail price to charge your business clients (except for specific products that have fixed pricing).

You can set your retail price globally for all your sales channels, such as sales teams, or you can set a different price for each sales channel.

## Automatically activating products

You can automatically activate new product purchases by checking the 'Auto-activate when ordered' box. When this option is enabled and your client purchases the product, it will be automatically activated without requiring any additional steps from you.

## White-label branding

Whenever possible, products in the Marketplace are built with white-label branding in mind. This means you can present the product to your client with your own branding.

## Upgrade paths

Some products may have different tiers or plans. If a product has upgrade options, a client can upgrade from one tier to a higher tier.

## Free trials

Some products offer a free trial period. During this period, neither you nor your client will be billed for the product. You can see if a product offers a free trial in the pricing table on the product details page.

## Team access to products

If you distribute access to applications through teams, you'll notice a 'Team Access' section in the product details. This section shows you which teams have access to the product.
