# Edit, Archive, Restore, or Delete a Package

Published and Draft packages can be edited, archived, and deleted at any time as needed. If you're making an adjustment or revamping packages in your store, your changes will be live immediately.

If you have a package that you no longer want to offer to your customers, and you don't intend to offer this package in the future, you can choose to archive it and/or delete it. You will still be able to see archived packages in **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages** when using the "Archived" filter.

Archived packages can be restored if you want to use them again, or they can be permanently deleted.
