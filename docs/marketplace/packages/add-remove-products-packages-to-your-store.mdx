# Add/Remove Products & Packages to your Store

Your Store is your customers' gateway to overcoming their needs. Through it, you can offer products and solutions that fit your business model. Your customers can explore your Store in Business App, or you can embed your Store on your website.

To add a product to your Store, you will need to start selling that product, and then package it. This guide explains how to complete the second step—packaging and publishing the product, as well as how to remove products from your store.

## How to Add/Remove Products and Packages

**Add Products to your Store**

When you start selling a product, you will be prompted to skip adding it to your store or add it to your store at its suggested retail price. You can stop selling the product anytime, by navigating to Marketplace > Discover Products, search for the product and scroll down to the bottom of the page to click the Stop Selling button.

Did you know that you can also sell your own products and services with Vendasta? Learn how to add what you already sell by creating a custom product in Vendor Center.

If you don't want to show a product in your store in certain markets, you can change its availability per market while viewing the product's page in Marketplace > Products on its Available in-store section.

Products you're selling will appear in your Public Store (which you can preview in Marketplace > Manage Store) and Business App > Store.

## Add Recommended Packages to your Store

Recommended packages are bundles of products that Vendasta has curated to work well together.

To add a recommended package to your Store:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Marketplace** > **Packages**.
2. Click on the Recommended Packages tab.
3. Browse or search for packages you want to add to your Store.
   - If you need further details about the package, click on the package card.
4. Once you've found a package you want to sell, click Add to Store on the package card, or click Copy on the Package Details page.
5. Review and edit the package information as needed.
   - If you have multiple Markets, select a Market to publish the package in. The product will not appear in Markets that are not selected.
6. Click Save and publish to make the package available for sale immediately.
   - To continue working on the package at a later time, click Save as draft. Draft packages can be published at any time from the Packages tab.

Your published packages will appear in your Public Store (which you can preview in **Marketplace** > Manage Store) and **Business App** > **Store**

## Add custom packages to your Store

To create your package and add it to your Store:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Marketplace** > **Packages**
2. Click Create Package.
3. Name your package. This name will be displayed to customers in your Public Store and Business App.
4. Click + Add product or service to choose what you want to include in the package.
   Only products you're selling will appear in this list.
5. A product's retail price will be automatically entered into the Retail Price column. This is the price your customers will see in your Public Store Business App.
   - Change the price of the package by entering a new value into the Retail price field.
   - If you haven't set a retail price for a product in Marketplace > Products yet, it will default to the Vendor's Suggested Retail Price (USD, CAD, and AUD only).
   - Rearrange package contents by clicking and dragging an individual line item above or below others. Remove items from the package by clicking the X on the line item.
6. Edit the package's Purchase behavior to change what happens when customers click the Get it Now button on your package in the Public Store or the Store tab in Business App.
   - Select Add to Shopping Cart to allow customers to add the package to their Shopping Cart when they click Get it Now
   - Select Contact Sales to launch a contact form when customers click Get it Now 
   - Select External URL to specify a URL to redirect your customer to when they click Get it Now
7. Review the package's retail price and wholesale cost.
   - The display price of a package can be modified by selecting Show as Starting At price (to indicate that prices may change based on certain factors) or selecting Show Contact Sales instead of price (to hide the total price of the package). We recommend using either of these settings with the Purchase behavior set to the Contact Form option, as these settings make a package incompatible with the Shopping Cart. 
8. Add any relevant marketing content (optional):
   - Click on any of the fields in the Marketing Material preview to begin editing
   - Click Save under the field you're editing to save your changes
   - If you are adding a single product to a package, the package will automatically use the product's marketing material.
9. Depending on how you intend to market a package, you can choose to show or hide the names and product-specific details of products within the package using the Show product icons and names and Show product details options.
   - When the Show product icons and names setting is off for a package, [invoices](/marketplace/marketplace-packages/vendasta-marketplace-invoices) created for or including the package will not show the products contained in the package as line items—only the package name and the total price of the package will be displayed

Click Publish to make the package available for sale immediately. To continue working on the package at a later time, click Save Draft. Draft packages can be published at any time from the **Marketplace** > **Packages** tab.

Your published packages will appear in your Public Store (which you can preview in **Marketplace** > Manage Store) and **Business App** > **Store**.

## Preview packages

You can preview your packages to test how they will look in your public store and Business App.

To preview a package:

1. Go to Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages.
2. Click the Menu (3 vertical dots on the right side) on the package card.
3. Click Preview.

## Remove Products from Store

You can decide whether or not a product you are selling is available in your store. 

To do so, navigate to Partner Center > Marketplace > Products > Select the product you want to remove/add from your Store > Check yes/no to add/remove the product from the Store.

If you have multiple Markets, you can select whether or not the product will be available in the Store in a particular Market. 

*Please note that only the products that you have started selling will show under the Products tab. Learn how to start selling a product.*
