# How do I remove duplicate packages or products in my store?

## Issue

After categorizing packages or products into different categories, the **Public Store** shows duplicate listings for the same packages or products.

## Cause

This issue occurs when **Business App** and **Public Store** are checked for the same product, causing the system to display duplicates.

## Solution

1. **Go to Partner Center**

2. **Search for the Duplicated Product**
   - In the **Product** section, search for the product or package that is being duplicated.

3. **Access Product Overview**
   - Click on the product and go to the **Product Overview** page.

4. **Uncheck Business App & Public Store**
   - In the product settings, uncheck both the **Business App** and **Public Store** options.

5. **Refresh and Verify**
   - Refresh the page, then return to your **Public Store**. The duplicate package or product should no longer appear.
