Manage Store is where you can customize the settings and appearance of your store including theme, categories, and currency. Stores can be customized per market.

## Why is Managing Your Store Important?

Managing your store allows you to fully customize the look and feel of your public storefront to match your brand or market. Before you embed your store on your website, you can choose how packages are displayed, change the appearance, and set the currency the Store operates.

## How to Customize the Appearance of the Public Store

With more control over your Public Store's appearance, you can ensure that it closely matches your brand's visual identity. The store within each market can be customized by navigating to the dropdown selection in the top right corner of the page.

To change the appearance of your public store, navigate to **Partner Center** > **Marketplace** > **Manage Store** > **Theme**. You can customize the following:

* **Color**
  * Logo Bar
  * Background
  * Accent
  * Primary Category
  * Secondary Category

* **Font**
  * Primary Font
  * Secondary Font

**Note that your Public Store's theme will not affect the Store tab in Business App.**

If you embed your Public Store on your website, you can also try setting your Store's background to full transparency. This will effectively remove your Public Store's background and give the impression of your store's contents sitting directly on the background of your website.

Each change you make will automatically update the Store preview. When you've perfected your store's appearance, click Save. Your Public Store will now use these color settings anywhere you've linked to it or embedded it.

## How to Create Custom Categories

A number of product categories are available by default in the Public Store, however, you're also able to add your preferred Custom Categories and which packages are placed within those custom categories. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Navigate to **Partner Center** > **Marketplace** > **Manage Store** > **Categories**
2. Click the dropdown next to Categories to expand the tab
3. Click on + Add Category
4. Type in the category name in the blank field provided
5. Assign packages to these categories and publish them to your Public Store and Business App. **Note: Categories are only applicable to the packages.**

## How to Set the Store Currency

1. Navigate to **Partner Center** > **Marketplace** > **Manage Store** > **Currency**
2. Choose the currency your store uses to display prices and accept payments

The default currency set for your store will not override the retail prices you have set for a package or a product. This setting will only affect products and packages that you haven't set a retail price for yet.

If you have not set a custom retail price per product or package, Marketplace products have suggested retail prices available in three currencies by default: USD, CAD, and AUD.
