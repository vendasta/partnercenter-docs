Trying to organize the packages in the All category, but when you drag and drop them they won't stay in the place where you want them to be?

In order to organize the packages in ALL categories, please go to Marketplace > Packages > Grid view (NOT LIST view). Click on "Edit Order" and then you can move the packages around via drag & drop.
