## Why is using account notes in Task Manager important?

Account notes help you keep track of important details surrounding your accounts. You may wish to use them for a few reasons:

- Log details about the client that aren't covered by their business profile
  - *For example, what hobbies do they have, and what specific requests do they have for the work you are doing*
- Put important, must-see notes front and center
  - *For example, you have a client that only posts on social media about a small number of subjects*
- Share important communications with other team members working on the account
  - *For example, a client is going through a hard time, so use extra discretion when talking with them about a subject*

Account notes show at the top of all tasks, ensuring they aren't missed. These notes are only visible to you and your team, so you don't need to worry about clients seeing what you've written.
