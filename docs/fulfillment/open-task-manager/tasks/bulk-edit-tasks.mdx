# Bulk Edit Tasks

Bulk editing tasks allows you to quickly update multiple tasks at once. This feature saves time by applying the same changes to multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Setting Up User Permissions

Before you can bulk edit tasks, you need to ensure you have the appropriate permissions:

1. **Account User Manager Role**: You must have the Account User Manager role, which gives you permission to manage users and their access levels.

2. **Team Member with Admin Access**: You need to be a team member with administrative permissions for the accounts whose tasks you want to edit.

3. **Login and Task Management Permissions**: These permissions must be set up correctly in your profile. Your administrator can configure these settings through the User Permissions area.

## Bulk Editing Process

Once you have the necessary permissions, you can bulk edit tasks using the following steps:

1. **Select Tasks to Edit**:
   - Navigate to the Tasks section of your dashboard
   - Select multiple tasks by checking the boxes next to each task you want to edit
   - You can filter tasks by status, date, or other criteria before selecting them

   - A dialog will open with options for bulk editing

   - Make your changes to the selected fields
   - Click "Save" to apply the changes to all selected tasks

3. **Review Your Changes**:
   - After saving, the tasks will be updated with your changes
   - Verify that the edits were applied correctly

## Best Practices

- **Filter Tasks First**: Use filters to narrow down the list of tasks before selecting them for bulk editing
- **Double-Check Selection**: Make sure you've selected only the tasks you want to edit before applying changes
- **Communicate Changes**: If you're editing tasks assigned to other team members, make sure to communicate the changes you've made
- **Regular Updates**: Use bulk editing regularly to keep tasks organized and up-to-date

## Limitations

- Some task fields may not be available for bulk editing
- You cannot edit tasks from different accounts simultaneously
- Custom fields may have specific requirements or limitations for bulk editing
