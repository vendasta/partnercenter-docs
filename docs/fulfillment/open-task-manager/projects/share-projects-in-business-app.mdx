### Additional notes on sharing projects in Business App

- To show a project in Business App, at least one task needs to be made visible as well.
- Tasks without an associated project cannot be shown in Business App.
- When a task is completed in Task Manager and it's been set to show in Business App, that task will appear with a checkmark, and the progress bar for the project will fill.
