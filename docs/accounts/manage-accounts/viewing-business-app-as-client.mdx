As a Partner Center admin, there may be times you need to know what a user will see when logging in to [Business App](/accounts/business-app). To do so, you can impersonate that user using one of the following options.

## Option 1: Impersonate a user

If you want to only see exactly what a user sees, you can impersonate that user. This can be done in two ways:

### From the "Manage Users" tab

1. From **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Users**, click ![](/img/accounts/view_business_app_icon1.png) next to the User you wish to view Business App as.

### From "Manage Accounts"

There are two ways to access Business App from the Manage Accounts page.

1. Go to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts** and click on an account the user has access to.
2. Under the "Users" heading, click ![](/img/accounts/view_business_app_icon2.png) next to the user you wish to view Business App as.
3. Click **Impersonate**.

## Option 2: Access Business App as an admin

You can access Business App as an admin via the following.

:::note
Accessing Business App in these ways will bring you into **Admin view**. This allows you to navigate between all the accounts you have access to. This may not be representative of the accounts the user can see.
