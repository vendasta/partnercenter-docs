The Business Category ensures that all sources and industry statistics are relevant to a particular account. You can enter more than one Business Category, but only the first will be used for setting visibility sources. All Vendasta customers have access to a category system based off of Google's 4000+ categories.

As you can see in the screenshot above, you can select sub-categories to fine-tune the Business Category. Most categories go only two levels deep. The advantage of selecting more specific categories is that listing sources will be better tailored to these categories, resulting in a better experience for the client.

## Why is the business category important?

Choosing the correct business category can significantly boost a local business' Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and search engine results page (SERP) ranking. This is especially true for Google Business Profile, as there are over 4000 categories to choose from that can either make it easier or harder for potential customers to find that business.

For example, a local Pizza Restaurant can set its primary category as "Pizza Restaurant" and may appear in search results for *Restaurants*, *Italian Restaurants*, or *Pizza*. It's important to choose a more specific category rather than a vague one whenever possible. Choosing a category like "Nail Salon" rather than just "Salon" is more likely to grab the attention of those looking for nail care rather than a haircut. If there is no suitable specific category, we advise you to choose a more general primary category.

## How to change the business category

Navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select the desired account > Edit >** Under the **Basics** section, select the primary and additional categories.
