# CRM in Partner Center FAQ

## Who can see these new tabs in Partner Center? Can I change this?

Yes, you can currently control who can see the new tabs in Partner Center for users with partner admin roles, here's how:

1. **Navigate to the 'My Teams' Page**:
   - Begin by navigating to the ["My Teams" page](https://partners.vendasta.com/my-team) in the Partner Center.

2. **Edit User Settings**:
   - Locate the user whose tab visibility you want to control.
   - Click on the row action menu (often represented by three dots or a similar icon) next to their name.
   - Select "Edit member" from the menu to modify their settings.

3. **Adjust Admin Permissions**:
   - In the user's settings, find the section labeled "Admin".
   - Click on "Show more permissions" to expand the list of available permissions.

4. **Configure Specific Permissions**:
   - You will see various permission settings. Focus on the following three to control CRM tab visibility:
     - **Can manage contacts in the platform**: Enabling this permission controls whether the user can see and manage the contact page, including the ability to create, edit, and delete contacts.
     - **Can manage activities in the platform**: This permission allows the user to create, edit, and delete activities, including tasks.
     - **Can manage companies in the platform**: By enabling this, the user gains or loses the ability to see the company page and to create, edit, or delete company information.

Adjusting these permissions will effectively control the user's ability to view and interact with specific pages and features within the Partner Center, ensuring they have access to only the necessary tools for their role.

## Does a contact have access like a user has access?

By default, a contact does not automatically gain access to the company's Business App, however, you can easily provide them with access by sending an invitation. Here's how to do it:

1. **Navigate to the Business App Instance**:
   - Start by going to the company's profile page that corresponds to the specific Business App instance you want the contact to access.

2. **Access the Contacts Section**:
   - On the company's profile page, look for the "Contacts" option in the association panel, typically found on the right side of the page.

3. **Locate or Add the Contact**:
   - Search for the contact you wish to grant access to within the contacts list.
   - If the contact is not listed, click "Add Contact" to associate a new contact with the company.

4. **Send the Invitation**:
   - Once you find or add the contact, check their information card for an "Invite to Business App" button.
   - If instead, you see a last login date, this indicates that the contact already has access to Business App.

Following these steps will allow you to manage access to the company's Business App, ensuring that the right contacts have the necessary permissions.

This upcoming integration represents a significant step forward in streamlining your scheduling and CRM activities, allowing for more efficient and automated workflows. Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the end of the year.

## Why would I use companies over accounts right now?

In the future, we will integrate most of the account features into the company pages, streamlining the user experience, however, as of now, accounts and companies will serve different purposes:

- **Accounts:** These are mainly used for handling your financial dealings within Vendasta. This covers billing details, product activations, and payment histories. To initiate these processes, you will need to create an account from the company if it has not already been created.
  
  **Companies:** These are centered on building and maintaining customer relationships. They help you track potential leads and manage ongoing client interactions through the activity timeline.

So, if your role revolves around administrative functions, handling billing issues, and managing orders, opt for **Accounts**. They provide the necessary tools for effective financial management and operational administration.

If your job is focused on generating new sales, nurturing client relationships, and growing revenue, **Companies** are more apt. They offer the resources and framework for tracking leads, maintaining client relationships, and boosting sales.

While we are moving towards integrating account features into company pages, currently, the choice between using accounts or companies depends heavily on your specific job functions. Accounts are tailored for financial and administrative tasks, whereas companies are ideal for sales, CRM, and revenue growth activities.
