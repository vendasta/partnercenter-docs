# Importing and Exporting CRM Contacts and Companies

## Bulk Importing Contacts and Companies in Vendasta

In the Vendasta CRM, you can efficiently add or update multiple contacts and companies at once by importing them in a single file.

## Before You Begin

Before initiating an import:

- Ensure you have permission to manage CRM contacts and companies.
- Confirm that each contact entry includes at least one of the following: First name, last name, email, or phone number.
- Ensure each company entry includes a company name.

## How to Import CRM Records

To import records, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Upload CSV**

Click "Import" in the top right corner of the contact table. You'll be guided through a three-step process to complete the import.

Upload a CSV file containing the data you want to import, then click "Next." You can use the optional CSV template to ensure your file is correctly formatted.

**Step 2: Map Fields**

- Map the fields from your CSV file to the corresponding fields in the CRM for contacts and companies. The system will attempt to auto-map columns to existing CRM fields, but you can manually adjust these mappings as needed.
- For each column, choose whether it relates to a contact or company, then select the specific CRM field to map it to. Once you've completed the mapping, click "Next."

**Step 3: Review Import**

- Review the records to be imported. You can choose to update existing contacts if a match is found based on ID, external ID, or email.
- After confirming your settings, click "Finish."

After completing the import, you can return to the contact or company table to view the newly created records. Records added through this process will be created with the record source "Bulk import" and record source drill down 1 with the bulk import ID for easy reference.
