- The blank template is the canvas from which you can create your own automations from scratch. When you set up a new blank template, you will be prompted to choose a trigger (the condition that kicks off the rest of the workflow) and steps (the actions that your automation does after the automation is triggered).
- To learn more about how to use automation, check out this great article: [Getting started with automations](/automations/getting-started-with-automations). You can also find all of our [available triggers](/automations/automation-triggers) and [available steps](/automations/automation-steps) to learn what they do and how they work.

## Recurring Sales Task

- This automation creates a recurring sales task on week days from 9 to 5 every 30 days for a full year.
- You can change how often the task is created by making an edit to the number of days in the delay step.

- When an account is created, segment it into one of three lists based on whether the business is located in one of your target markets or not.
- To use this automation, you will need to create lists that your accounts will be sorted into.
- Try using other account data to filter your accounts. For example, you could use custom fields or tags to have the automation segment your accounts. Once sorted, you could create separate automations that activate once an account has been added to a list and create unique workflows based on market segments and more.

## AGOGE Task Sequence on Company (Advanced Automation)

- This automation template is triggered manually and creates an opportunity if there isn't one open for the company. It will then follow the AGOGE sequence to create tasks on day 1, day 3, day 4, day 7, day 10, day 14, day 17, day 19, and day 24. It sends a reminder to the assigned salesperson if the task is not completed in 1 day for 5 times. After task completion, it will create another task on the next date on the AGOGE sequence. The sequence will stop when there are no open opportunities in the company or a task isn't completed within 5 days.
- To use this automation, you'll need to have a pipeline set up to create the sales opportunity, as well as have a product or package added to the opportunity.

## Nurture Cold Leads (Advanced Automation)
