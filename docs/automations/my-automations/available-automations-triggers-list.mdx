# Available Automations Triggers List: Events that start your automation

Automation triggers are specific actions that start your workflows. There are numerous triggers to choose from, and we're frequently adding more.

Some triggers are simple and are ready out-of-the-box, while other triggers may require specifying **trigger options**. Learn more about triggers [here](/automations/automations-my-automations/understanding-triggers).

Below is a full list of all currently available Automations Triggers: what the trigger is, an overview of what it does, any special cases, and example use cases. For some triggers, we may have a linked article with more detail on how the trigger works

## Triggers List

### Businesses

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| An account is created | Starts the workflow when an account is created. | The trigger is not able to detect likely duplicates (e.g. Jim's Mowing and Jim's mowing) | When an account in Quebec is added, tag the account as possibly needing a salesperson fluent in French. |

### Campaigns

| Trigger | Overview | Special Cases | Example Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| There's activity on a campaign email | Starts the workflow when a campaign email is opened or clicked. Open and click can be differentiated. | Only CTA clicks are counted. It is not possible to differentiate which link is clicked. There may be multiple users within the account, but the trigger only fires for the first user to click (unless the "run multiple times per account" setting is checked). <br/><br/>[Learn more about click tracking](/automations/automations-my-automations/tracking-email-clicks) | A campaign has been sent to prospective leads. When a lead clicks the email, assign a task, a salesperson, and mark as a hot lead. |

### Fulfillment

| Trigger | Overview | Special Cases | Example Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Products

| Trigger | Overview | Special Cases | Example Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A user on the account views a package | Starts the workflow when an SMB views a package in the store in Business App. | This was an original hot lead that has been migrated into built-in automation. | When an SMB shows interest in Website Pro, send a promotional email with a discount. |
| A product is activated | Starts the workflow when a product is activated. (This includes custom products enabled by the partner) | A product may be activated multiple times, but automation settings may mean the trigger is fired only once. | When a website trial product is activated, send an email advertising web development services. |
| A product is deactivated | Starts the workflow when a product is deactivated. (This includes custom products enabled by the partner) | A product may be deactivated multiple times, but automation settings may mean the trigger is fired only once. | When a high-profit product is canceled, notify a salesperson to follow up and investigate. |
| A shopping cart is updated | Starts the workflow when someone updates a shopping cart in the marketplace. | The shopping cart only includes the product marketplace. | When a shopping cart is updated, wait until an order is placed. If no order is placed after three days, send a follow-up email. |

### Sales

| Trigger | Overview | Special Cases | Example Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| An opportunity is created or status changed | Starts the workflow when an opportunity is created, moves into a new pipeline stage and/or is closed. | If an opportunity begins in the indicated pipeline stage the automation won't run. | When an opportunity is identified, upgrade the hotness level of an account. |
| A sales order status is changed | Starts the workflow when a sales order status changes. The sales order may originate from one or any source. | If the sales order begins with the indicated status, the automation may not fire. | When an order is drafted, wait up to 24 hours for the order status to move to pending. If it hasn't been issued after this time, create a task to investigate why the order wasn't completed. |
| A user on an account makes a payment | Starts the workflow when a customer makes a payment. The payment can succeed or fail. | None | When a payment fails, begin a Dunning process (i.e. using multiple actions) to ensure payment is collected. |
| A sales task status is changed | Starts the workflow when a sales task has its status changed to a specified status. The task's assignee and task name can also be specified for the event. | The corresponding "Delay until an event happens" action that uses this trigger doesn't currently allow assignee and task name filters, due to the task event being a resource that is fetched and used as output data on the trigger but similar infrastructure doesn't currently exist on the "delay" action. | When a task named "follow up" and assigned to "Joe Smith" changes its status to waiting on the customer, send an email letting the customer know. |
| A Snapshot Report is created | Starts the workflow when a Snapshot Report is created | All snapshots generally start as F ratings. This is because web scraping takes time. Users are advised to add delay steps after this trigger to ensure more accurate ratings are available. | When a Snapshot Report is created, create a task to schedule a follow-up call. Assign a fulfillment agent to that task. |

### Manual

| Trigger | Overview | Special Cases | Example Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Triggered Manually | Automations can also be triggered manually, much like shortcuts, whenever needed. Currently, manual automation triggers are available for Account Groups, Companies, Contacts, and Orders. | When managing customer interactions and data, users need a way to quickly initiate automations for specific accounts, companies, contacts, or orders on demand, so they can streamline repetitive tasks without waiting for scheduled triggers, allowing for greater flexibility and efficiency in managing their workflows. | When managing orders, I need the ability to manually add and remove tags through automation, so I can quickly update order information and keep it organized in real-time.<br/><br/>When a new order is created, I need a manual automation to check the order status and, based on an inputted number of days, automatically add a tag if the order remains in drafts and archive it if it exceeds the specified timeline, ensuring timely follow-up and efficient order management. |
