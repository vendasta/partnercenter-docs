# Create a new automation

Automations are a way to set up an automated process between Business App and Market to reduce manual work and the risk of human error. They allow you to configure a trigger and an action that will automatically occur when triggered.

## Creating a new automation

1. Log in to Business App and navigate to **Settings > Automations**.
2. Click **Create** at the top right of the screen.

   * **Description**: (Optional) Additional information about the automation
   * **Status**: Toggle to turn the automation on or off
