With **fulfillment integrations** and **event-generated tasks and projects**, task manager users can automatically generate both tasks and projects to scale their fulfillment team. Each time a specific product is purchased, a project can be created or generate tasks based on events such as reviews, mentions, listings, or Google Q&A. A Task Manager Integration will standardize your fulfillment process for a product by automating project and task creation in Task Manager.

## HOW does a Task Manager Integration work?

When task generation settings and fulfillment integrations are toggled on, tasks and projects automatically generate within Task Manager. These settings are turned on at a product or service level within Vendor Center and generated when that product is ordered in Partner Center. A task manager integration can create projects/tasks in your Task Manager or the Reseller's Task Manager.

## How to set up a Task Manager Integration

Navigate to Vendor Center > [Choose product] > Integration > Task Manager Integration > Toggle Integrate with Task Manager ON
