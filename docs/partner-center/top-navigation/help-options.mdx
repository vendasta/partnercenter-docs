## Submitting a Support Ticket

When we need to submit a ticket to Support on-Demand, it can be difficult to know what should be included, how much information is needed, and where should the request be submitted to. The short answer is all three of these are important to you, your partner, and Support on-Demand, and following this guide will answer all three of these questions!

For the best results, please include the following information in the body of the ticket or request:

- **Partner ID**
- **Account Group ID** (if applicable)
- **User or team member affected** (if applicable)
- **Replication Steps** (This should be a TL:DR of the issue and the steps you took to replicate it)
- **Screenshots** (or video) of error messages

When submitting a ticket, to Support on-Demand, your best channel is sending a ticket to support@vendasta.com. Partners can also contact us using the in-platform chat to reach an agent, and contracted Partners can call in to speak with a live agent 24/7.

Here is a great example of a submitted Support Request:

 *Hey Team,*

*Partner ID: XXXX*

*Account Group ID: AG-XXXXXXXXX*

*Partner FOOO is running into an issue with the Local SEO dashboard. Specifically within the Local SEO > Listing Sync section, and Google Business Profile.*

*I've attached a video walkthrough here of what we're experiencing.* 

*I'm pretty sure this is not the intended function (please let me know if I am wrong) - so what can the client or I do to have the proper reporting come in?*

*Thanks in advance for your help!*
