# What is the difference between default and custom domains?

When we set up your white-label, we will ask you about your preferences for the URLs your clients, prospects, and salespeople will see.

**Note:** Custom domains are only available with certain subscription tiers. Speak to your account manager for more information.

There are two options:

## Option 1: Default URLs

Predetermined domains with a customizable subdomain. Partners typically choose this option if they do not already own a domain or they simply need to get started immediately. Here are some examples:

- **Reputation Management:** [partnername].steprep.com
- **Social Marketing:** [partnername].socialsmbs.com
- **Local SEO:** [partnername].pdqs.mobi
- **Business App (client dashboard):** [partnername].smblogin.com

*The square brackets indicate the words you can change.*

## Option 2: Custom URLs

Fully customizable subdomains and domains. Partners typically choose this option if they already own a domain as well as access to its DNS settings.

If you choose this option, please tell us your preferred domains for each product. You can customize the subdomain as well as the domain (as long as it is a domain you own). To give you some ideas, our partners typically choose the following formats:

- **Reputation Management:** [reputation].[yourURL.com]
- **Social Marketing:** [social].[yourURL.com]
- **Local SEO:** [m].[yourURL.com]
- **Business App (client dashboard):** [login].[yourURL.com]
- **Partner Center:** [CRM].[yourURL.com]

*The square brackets indicate the words you can change.*

Fill in [this form](https://custom-domains-form.websitepro.hosting/) to send us your preferences, after which we will email you TXT and CNAME records, along with instructions on how to enter them into your DNS settings.
