We understand acquisitions, company rebrands, and more happen. We'll take the leg work off your plate, and make changing your company name and access URLs an easy switch.

## Request a Platform Rebrand

To rebrand your Vendasta Platform, please email support@vendasta.com with the following details:

- Preferred company name.
- Preferred sub-domain for default URLs.
- Updated accounting details (billing name and address), if applicable.

If you have previously set up a **custom domain** with our Support team, we ask that you work directly with them to update your URLs. Please submit [this form](https://custom-domains-form.websitepro.hosting/).

Your work is done! Our Support On-Demand team will reach out when this change goes live.
