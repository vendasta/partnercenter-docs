# Managing Edited Reviews

We have added some new functionality that will allow users to identify reviews that have been edited, along with the ability to review the history of edits for these reviews.

## How to Identify an Edited Review

Edited reviews can be identified via a banner notification at the top of the Review Card, which states "This review has been edited on [date]". The edit date displayed is the date the review content was most recently changed.

Additionally, an "Edited" badge will be shown next to the published date.

## How to View the History of Edits for a Review

If a review has been edited, you can view the history of edits by clicking the "Edited" badge next to the published date.

This will open a popup that shows all historical content changes for that review:

If there is no history of edits available for a review, the popup will display the following message:

## Important Notes About Edited Reviews

- An edited review will show a timestamp of when it was last edited and will display an "Edited" badge next to the date

- The edit icon looks like this:

- Reviews can be edited by the original reviewer directly on the review platform (like Google, Facebook, etc.)
- These edits happen outside of Vendasta's system and are simply reflected in our reporting
- Not all review platforms allow reviews to be edited, so this feature will only apply to reviews from platforms that support editing
- Historical content is tracked from the date this feature was implemented
- Only changes to the actual review content are tracked - changes to star ratings or other metadata are not tracked in the history
