# Settings for Google Ads Conversion Sources and Categories

Google Ads conversion has a selector card that allows you to select the metrics you want to track for sources and categories.

You can easily edit these options by launching Advertising Intelligence; then navigate to **Settings > Conversion Metrics** under Google Ads. Here, you can select any of the listed metrics to start monitoring.
