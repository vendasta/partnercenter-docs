With the Advanced Reporting add-on, users will have the ability to connect individual Ad Campaigns to their Advertising Intelligence account.

## Why is connecting individual ad campaigns important?

When connecting a Google Ads, Facebook Ads, or Microsoft Ads account, you are able to connect and display a specified list of individual campaigns in the reporting table. Users, such as advertisers of multi-location businesses, can display the metrics that are relevant to the appropriate account, allowing clients to efficiently view the proof of performance for only the campaigns that relate to their business or specific location.

## How does connecting individual ad campaigns work?

**With the Advanced Reporting add-on activated:**

1. Go to **Advertising Intelligence > Settings.**
2. On either Google Ads, Facebook Ads or Microsoft Ads, click **Connect**. 
3. In the pop-up window, choose the Ad account you would like to connect to your Advertising Intelligence account.
4. Click **Next**.
5. To connect to individual campaigns, check the box next to **Connect to individual campaigns.**
6. A list of the campaigns that are currently active will be listed below. Check the box next to each campaign you would like to display for this Advertising Intelligence account. 
   
   *Only the campaigns you select will display, and any future campaigns created will not display for this account. You will need to disconnect and reconnect your account in order to display them.*
