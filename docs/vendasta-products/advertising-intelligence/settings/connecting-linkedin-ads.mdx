4. **Review and Grant Permissions:** Follow the on-screen instructions to establish the connection and grant Advertising Intelligence the necessary permissions to access your LinkedIn Ads data.

## Accessing Your LinkedIn Ads Data

Once the connection is established, your LinkedIn Ads campaign metrics will be available within Advertising Intelligence. Here's where to find them:

- **All Tab:** Consolidated data for all your connected advertising platforms, including LinkedIn Ads, will be accessible under the "All" tab.

- **Dedicated LinkedIn Ads Tab:** Advertising Intelligence also provides a separate tab specifically showcasing your LinkedIn Ads campaign statistics.

This consolidated and dedicated view of your LinkedIn Ads data empowers you to analyze campaign performance within Advertising Intelligence, alongside data from your other connected advertising platforms.
