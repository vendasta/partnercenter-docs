1. In Advertising Intelligence, (**ONLY** *for Ad Campaigns managed by Vendasta*) you will see an additional side menu called "External Dashboard."
2. Once you click on that menu, it opens up a list of campaigns.
3. Individual Ad campaigns are selectable which will redirect to the MatchCraft Merchant Center.
