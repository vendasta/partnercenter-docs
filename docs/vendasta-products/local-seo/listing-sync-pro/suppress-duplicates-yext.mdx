2. Once you click to navigate to the Duplicates page, it will show a list of the duplicates that were found, which source they are on, and which location they are a duplicate of. There will also be options next to each of the duplicates to either suppress the duplicate or mark the listing as not a duplicate:

You just have to click on the action you would like to take, and your work here is done!

### **About Yext Duplicate Suppression**

Please note the following:

- **REVIEW**: Suppression requests are reviewed by Yext and/or the publisher to confirm that they are for duplicates of an existing Listing. Do not use this feature to suppress listings that are not duplicates of an existing Listing.

- **TIMELINE**: Review usually takes no more than 24 hours, after which suppression happens immediately on many sites. Other sites may take up to one week or longer.

- **RESULT**: Suppression causes listings to be removed from search results on the publisher. In most cases, the URL of the suppressed listing redirects to the correct listing, but sometimes the old URL shows the new content or returns an error.
