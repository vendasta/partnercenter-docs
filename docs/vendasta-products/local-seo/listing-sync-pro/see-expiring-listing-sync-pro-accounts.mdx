# See expiring Listing Sync Pro accounts in the Partner Center Dashboard

We've made it easier for Partners to determine when Listing Sync Pro accounts need to be renewed.

In addition to Citation Builder, the **Highlights section** of the Partner Center **Home** tab will now also show Listing Sync Pro accounts that have expired or are about to expire in the next 30 days.

This applies to both Listing Sync Pro and Listing Sync Pro powered by Yext.
