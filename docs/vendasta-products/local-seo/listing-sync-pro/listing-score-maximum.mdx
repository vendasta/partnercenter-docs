The listing score per source has a maximum attainable value but we don't have a maximum listing score for a location or a maximum total. This is a dynamic value that keeps changing as we add more sources, and is compared directly to the industry average. The maximum listing score per source can be found on the listing table under the **Listing Sync** tab of Local SEO.
