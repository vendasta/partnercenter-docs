# Listing Sync Pro: International SKU

Listing Sync Pro allows you and your clients to instantly create and update listings on an established network of search engines, social networks, business directories, and navigation systems by creating and fixing listings all within one platform. Listing Sync Pro keeps your listings protected from any third-party changes giving your clients confidence in your service and providing proof of performance.

Though there are multiple Listing Sync Pro plans specific to different countries available, this International package serves as a more general SKU that is available to any business in any country. This is a great opportunity for Partners who will be able to serve more clients and no longer be limited geographically. For more information on this package, [click here](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MS/addon/A-5PKSZWWLWK).

The international plan is available to all Vendasta Partners who are users of Listing Sync Pro. If you have any questions, please reach out to our [Support on Demand team](/vendasta-resources/get-help/submit-a-ticket).
