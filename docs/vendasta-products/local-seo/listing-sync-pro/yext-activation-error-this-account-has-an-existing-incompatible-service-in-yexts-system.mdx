# Yext activation error: "This account has an existing incompatible service in Yext's system"

In this case, since the business owner has an existing relationship with Yext, that relationship will have to be ended before they can start one through Vendasta.

To do this, the business owner (*NOT the partner*) will be required to send an email to [locationconflict@yext.com](mailto:locationconflict@yext.com) and let them know they would like to end any existing relationships with Yext.

Once this is complete, you will be able to activate the product through us.
