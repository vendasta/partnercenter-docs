# Will Listing Sync Pro sync to a PO Box?

No, using a P.O. Box as the Business address will prevent the listing from syncing.

When setting up the business profile, we recommend entering a street address, then selecting 'Service Area Business' if the client prefers to hide their address on listing sources.
