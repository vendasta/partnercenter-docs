# Voice Search Directories

Listing Sync Pro syncs to Alexa, and Siri. This is for both Uberall and Yext managed Listing Sync Pro products.

Google Business Page sync will get the data from the Google voice assistant.

Please keep in mind that voice search directories will only accept businesses that have a physical location.
