In this article, we cover how data aggregators like TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze and Foursquare help businesses distribute accurate and consistent information across directories, search engines, and mapping services. You'll learn how these aggregators collect, verify, and share business data, how they function within Citation Builder, and why they are essential for improving local search visibility and online presence.

## What Are Data Aggregators?

Data aggregators collect and distribute consumer and business data to hundreds of directories, review sites, search engines, and other platforms. They play a crucial role in ensuring businesses appear in key locations across the local search ecosystem.

These aggregators also power modern applications such as Apple's Siri and various personal navigation systems by providing accurate business data. Their role is to verify, clean, and maintain high-quality business information before distributing it to other companies that require local business data.

The data aggregators used in Vendasta's **Citation Builder** are:

* **TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze**
* **Foursquare**

Within Citation Builder, businesses can track their data submission status to Neustar/Localeze through two key columns:

* **The first column** indicates whether the business's information has been successfully sent and accepted by Neustar/Localeze.
* **The second column** shows reporting from six key platforms that receive data from Neustar/Localeze: 
  * **The Real Yellow Pages (yp.com)**
  * **Waze**
  * **Bing**
  * **Manta**
  * **Superpages**
  * **Dexknows**

When a business's data is successfully verified across all six sources, Citation Builder displays green checkmarks in the second column, confirming that the data is accurate and widely distributed.

## Foursquare as a Data Aggregator in Citation Builder

**Foursquare** is a global location data platform that collects, curates, and distributes business location data. Originally a social check-in app, Foursquare has evolved into a powerful data aggregator that provides business information to major brands, applications, and search engines.

**How Foursquare Works:**

1. **Data Collection**: Foursquare compiles business data from user-generated content, direct business submissions, and third-party sources.
2. **Data Validation**: Businesses can claim and update their listings, while Foursquare ensures accuracy through verification processes.
3. **Data Distribution**: Foursquare syndicates business data to major platforms, including mapping applications, search engines, and social networks.

**What Data Does Foursquare Provide?**

Foursquare provides comprehensive business data, including:

* **Business Name**
* **Address**

* **Website URL**

**How Foursquare Works in Citation Builder:**

In Citation Builder, businesses can submit their information to Foursquare to increase their visibility across platforms that rely on Foursquare's data. However, it is important to note that:

* **Foursquare operates as a submission-only provider**, meaning that while Citation Builder submits data to Foursquare, it does not actively monitor or update data in the same way as Neustar/Localeze.
* Businesses can still claim and manage their Foursquare profiles independently for enhanced control over their data.

Foursquare data is widely used by apps, search engines, and mapping services, making it an essential source for local business information. By submitting data to Foursquare through Citation Builder, businesses can improve their online presence and local search rankings across various platforms.

By leveraging Neustar/Localeze and Foursquare in Citation Builder, businesses ensure their information is accurately distributed, improving visibility, consistency, and search engine credibility.
