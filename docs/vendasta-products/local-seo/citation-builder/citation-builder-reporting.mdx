**Citation Builder** in Local SEO provides clients with **proof of performance** and **citation growth tracking**. This feature enables clients to see how their business citations are increasing over time, reinforcing the value of maintaining accurate and consistent business information online.

Businesses outside of the United States are unable to purchase Citation Builder to grow their online citations. However, they will still see the reporting outlined below. This means non-US businesses can employ other tactics to improve their online presence and this product will still report on the growth of their online citations over time.

## What Reporting is Displayed within Citation Builder?

Citations play a **critical role in local search rankings**. A citation is created whenever a business's **name, address, or phone number (NAP)** appears online. Each new citation helps improve **local visibility** and enhances **search engine rankings** on platforms like Google and Bing. 

The reporting featured in Citation Builder enables clients to monitor their growing citation presence in real-time. The longer they keep the product active, the more citations their business accumulates, helping establish greater trust with search engines and potential customers.
