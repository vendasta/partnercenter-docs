## 1. How does Citation Builder work?

Citation Builder submits your client's business information to the main **data aggregators**, **TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze** and **Foursquare**. These aggregators distribute the data to **hundreds of directories, search engines, navigation systems, voice assistants, and mobile apps**. Over time, these sources query the aggregators to retrieve updated business information, ensuring accuracy and consistency across the web.

When multiple sources contain the same business data, two key benefits occur:

1. **Improved search engine confidence** – Google's web crawlers detect consistent business details across multiple sites, reinforcing trust in the business's legitimacy.
2. **SEO improvements** – Backlinks are created as more directories reference the business, enhancing local search rankings.

## 2. What is a data aggregator?

Data aggregators collect and distribute consumer and business data to directories, review sites, search engines, and apps. They play a crucial role in ensuring **business information remains accurate and up-to-date** across a wide range of online sources. Aggregators also power **modern applications like Apple's Siri and personal navigation systems**.

## 3. How long does Citation Builder take to update business data?

- **Business data is submitted within 24 hours** of being entered in Citation Builder.
- **Aggregators confirm data acceptance within 6–8 weeks**.
- **Aggregators distribute data to various citation sources**, which may take **2–3 months** to publish updates.
- **Search engines and directories pick up updates over time**, based on their own refresh cycles.

Since data distribution is **not instant**, keeping Citation Builder active long-term ensures business details remain updated across sources.

## 4. Why is Citation Builder a yearly subscription?

Citation Builder is designed as an **ongoing service** to maintain and build online presence over time. Once a business's data is distributed to aggregators, individual directories and search engines reference it **at varying intervals**. If a business discontinues Citation Builder, data consistency may degrade due to **user-generated edits, outdated sources, or conflicting third-party updates**.

By keeping a **yearly subscription active**, your client ensures:

- Their **business data remains accurate** and refreshed **every month**.
- Their **search engine trust and rankings** remain strong.
- They avoid **data degradation** over time.

## 5. How often can updates be made to the business profile?

Your clients can update their **business profile information at any time** while their Citation Builder subscription is active. These changes will be **submitted to the aggregators within 24 hours**.

## 6. What if a business has duplicate listings? How does Citation Builder handle them?

Citation Builder **does not delete duplicate listings** directly. Instead, it ensures that **authoritative data sources reference the correct business information**. Over time, directories and platforms that rely on data aggregators will adjust their records to reflect accurate business details, reducing inconsistencies.

## 7. What countries is Citation Builder available for?

Currently, Citation Builder is available **only for US-based businesses**.

## 8. Why does Foursquare show 'Not Applicable'?

If 'Not Applicable' appears in the **Foursquare column** of Citation Builder, it means the business is **hiding its physical address** (operating as a **Service Area Business**).

**Foursquare requires a visible address** to process business data. If the address is hidden, the entire business submission will be **excluded from Foursquare's database**.

## 9. What happens to a business's citations if they cancel Citation Builder?

If Citation Builder is canceled:

- Vendasta **stops submitting updates** to data aggregators.
- Business citations **will no longer be actively monitored**.
- Over time, **third parties may override existing citations**, leading to inconsistencies.

Vendasta **does not remove** business citations from sites, but clients can manually claim their citations if they wish to maintain control.

## 10. Who has access to the Citation Builder page?

- **Channel partners** have full access to the Citations Page for clients with **Local SEO and Reputation Management Pro** active on their accounts.
- **Clients** can access the Citations Page to track citation growth unless the feature is disabled in **Partner Center**.

## 11. Can I disable the Citations Page for my clients?

Yes, the **Citations Page is enabled by default** in Local SEO. To disable it:

1. **Go to** Partner Center > Administration.
2. **Select** Customize.
3. **Click** on Vendasta Product Settings.
4. **Select** the pencil icon next to Local SEO.
5. **Uncheck** the option for **Show 'Citations' Tab**.

**Save** your changes to remove client access.
