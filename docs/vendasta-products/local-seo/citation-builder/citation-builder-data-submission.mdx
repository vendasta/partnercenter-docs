In this article, we cover how Citation Builder submits business information to major data aggregators, ensuring accurate and consistent listings across online directories, search engines, and review sites. You'll learn what data is submitted, how aggregators verify business information, the role of toll-free numbers, and the importance of selecting the correct business category to improve visibility and local search rankings.

## What Information Does Citation Builder Send?

Citation Builder submits business information to two major data aggregators: **Foursquare** and **TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze**. These aggregators distribute the data to hundreds of online directories, search engines, and review sites.

**Primary Business Listing Data:**

The following essential business information is sent and utilized by both data aggregators:

- **Business Name**
- **Street Address**
- **City**
- **State/Province/Region**
- **Country**
- **Zip/Postal Code**
- **Phone Number**
- **Website**

**Additional Business Listing Data:**

While not all aggregators accept this secondary data, it enhances business citations by providing more details:

- **Hours of Operation**
- **Payment Methods**
- **Business Description**
- **Services**
- **Brands**
- **Keywords**
- **Landmark**
- **Toll-Free Number**

**Healthcare Industry Data (Professional Records):**

If a business is categorized under healthcare, Citation Builder also submits the following data where applicable:

- **Firm/Clinic/Office Name**
- **First Name**
- **Last Name**
- **Email**
- **Professional Credential**
- **NPI (National Provider Identifier)**
- **Gender**
- **Insurances Accepted**
- **School**

## How Do Data Aggregators Verify Business Information?

Each data provider has its own verification methods. Generally, they compare the submitted data against authoritative sources, such as **USPS records**. Formatting adjustments may be made to align with their standards. Aggregators may also **call or email businesses** for verification.

**Neustar/Localeze Verification Process:**

- Once Citation Builder is activated, Vendasta submits a request to **claim the citation** for accuracy.
- If your client has already claimed the listing, **Neustar/Localeze will send a conflict resolution email** requesting approval.
  - If the client **approves the release**, Neustar/Localeze transfers control to Vendasta.
  - If the client does **not respond within 10 business days**, Neustar/Localeze automatically releases the listing.
  - If the client **denies the release**, Vendasta will not be able to update the listing.

**Foursquare Verification Process:**

Foursquare, unlike Neustar/Localeze, operates as a **submission-only** provider in Citation Builder. This means that while business data is submitted to Foursquare, it does not actively verify or manage listing updates in the same manner as Neustar/Localeze. However, Foursquare ensures data accuracy by:

- **Cross-referencing user-generated content** with authoritative sources.
- **Allowing businesses to claim their listings manually** through Foursquare's business management tools.
- **Providing location intelligence services** that distribute data to apps, mapping services, and social platforms.
- **Ensuring accuracy and reducing duplicate entries** by consolidating similar business records into a unified listing.

While Citation Builder helps businesses submit data to Foursquare, clients may need to manually claim their Foursquare listing for full control over updates and additional enhancements.

**Are Toll-Free Numbers Accepted?**

- Citation Builder **supports toll-free numbers (e.g., 1-800)**.
- Neustar/Localeze has a **dedicated field** for toll-free numbers and syncs them accordingly.
- However, to list a toll-free number as the **main business phone**, a standard (non-toll-free) number must also be provided.
- Neustar/Localeze **may accept toll-free numbers as a primary number but does not always guarantee it**.

**How to Update a Client's Logo and Primary Photo in Citation Builder:**

To change the **logo or primary photo**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Local SEO > Business Profile** for the desired account.
2. Click **Images** and upload the main logo.

**Why Is It Important to Submit the Correct Business Category or Taxonomy ID?**

Selecting the correct **Business Category or Taxonomy ID** is essential for:

- **Ensuring accurate classification**: This helps data aggregators place the business in the right category, improving discoverability.
- **Avoiding business data issues**: Some directories **do not support** generic categories like "Other," which may result in the business being omitted.
- **Maintaining sync compatibility**: A mismatch in business categories can cause **data syncing errors** with citation sources.

By ensuring accurate and complete data submission, Citation Builder helps businesses maintain a consistent and authoritative online presence across multiple directories and search platforms.
