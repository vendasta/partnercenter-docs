The "Accuracy Report" column showcases our independent reporting system. When a listing source is added, our system pushes the Business Profile data to that listing directory. The listing directory then communicates back to our systems, letting us know that the data was accepted, rejected, or published onto their systems. The "Accuracy Report" column reports that data.

An "accurate" status ensures that there is a **100% match** between the Business Profile data and the listing source. Some directories have special rules that we must adhere to with data submission. Listings will go through a "cleansing" process to remove the data that goes against the directories' data acceptance rules. Due to this cleansing process, you may see the "Accuracy Report" column not displaying a 100% match with the Business Profile data.

Some directories have special rules that we must adhere to with data submission. Listings will go through a "cleansing" process in the backend to remove the data that goes against the directories' data acceptance rules. This involves reformatting things like the business name, address, and latitude/longitude.

Certain directories only want to receive cleansed data, meaning we will only ever send them cleansed data. For all other directories, we first send uncleansed data, and then we will update with the cleansed data if needed.

Directories with mandatory cleansing are:
- Apple
- Yelp
- Foursquare
- Baidu
- HERE
- Tripadvisor

Cleansing data submitted to these listing directories ensures the listing will not get flagged by the directory for additional review, or worse, get blacklisted and removed from the directory.

Due to this data cleansing process, you may see the "Accuracy Report" column not displaying a 100% match with the Business Profile data.
