# Apple Business Listings

**Sync your client's business listing information to Apple directly from Local SEO Pro**

Syncing your client's business with Apple through Local SEO is a great way to ensure the business information is accurately represented on Apple Maps and other Apple services. This integration helps businesses enhance their visibility and reach millions of potential customers using Apple devices.

### **Why are Apple Listings important?**

1. **Increased Visibility**: Apple Maps is used by millions of people daily to find businesses and services. By listing your business, you increase the chances of attracting local customers.
2. **Accurate Information**: Ensuring your business details are correct on Apple Maps helps potential customers find you easily and trust the information they see.
3. **Enhanced Features**: Apple listings synced through Local SEO allows businesses to add additional details like logos, cover images, and custom action links to their listings, making them stand out.

### **How do Apple Listings Work?**

1. **Data Synchronization**: We send your business information to Apple, ensuring only the most recent and accurate data is included. This helps maintain the integrity of your listing.
2. **Confidence Score**: Apple uses a confidence score to determine the accuracy of the data. If the confidence score is high, your information is more likely to be displayed prominently. Apple verifies data against the business website, so make sure the website is up to date before syncing to Apple.
3. **Automatic Updates**: Changes to the Business profile are pushed to Apple automatically, keeping your Maps listing up to date.

### **How to start syncing with Apple**

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select an account** (The account must have Local SEO Pro).
2. Go to the Listing Sync tab.
3. From here, you will see the Apple card.

*Please note that Apple does not accept Service Area Businesses.*
