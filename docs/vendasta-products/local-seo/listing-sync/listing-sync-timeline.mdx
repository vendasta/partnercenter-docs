description: "Timeline expectations for listing synchronization across different directories"

The majority of listing sites will be submitted to the listing source instantaneously (15 minutes to an hour), but listings can take up to **4 weeks** to be published across our network of listing sources.

***Upon initial activation of Listing Sync Pro, please allow 6-8 weeks for all sources to sync.***

All listing directories have different updating cycles. Please allow the directories 24-72 hours to process the update before attempting to troubleshoot the listing. GPS directories (Audi, BMW, etc.) can take up to 30 days. Bing and Apple Maps can take longer as they are aggregators and pull data from other sources in addition to the data we send to the directory.

Additionally, some directories have special rules that we must adhere to with data submission. Listings will go through a "[cleansing](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-local-seo/vendasta-products-local-seo-listing-sync/listing-cleansing)" process in the backend to reformat things like the business name, address, and latitude/longitude. This data cleansing will add more time to the listing sync timelines.

Directories with mandatory cleansing are:

- Apple
- Yelp
- Foursquare
- Baidu
- HERE

If the listing has been in a "syncing" status for over 4 weeks, please contact support with the account name, and specific source.
