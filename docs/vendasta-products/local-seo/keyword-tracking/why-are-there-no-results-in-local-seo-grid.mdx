## Potential Cause

- If the business is a **Service Area Business (SAB)**, the issue might arise from a misalignment between:
  1. The **keywords** being targeted.
  2. The **address** is listed in the business profile.

**How the Map Works**:
- The business address listed in the profile serves as the **center point** for the map area displayed in Local Grid searches.
- If the targeted keywords correspond to a region far from the listed address, **no rankings** will appear within the grid.

## Workarounds to Improve Local Grid Results

1. **Align Keywords with Business Address**:
   - Update the targeted keywords to focus on the area surrounding the listed business address.
   - This ensures the keywords match the map's central area and improves visibility in search results.

2. **Change the Business Address (Use with Caution)**:
   - Consider updating the business address to a location closer to the region targeted by the keywords.
   - **Important**: This approach is **not recommended** as it may impact the accuracy of the business listing and lead to issues.

## Best Practices

- Prioritize aligning keywords with the current address for accurate and effective results.
