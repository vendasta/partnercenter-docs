## Question: Why might a business rank highly on Google Maps within a 1-2 mile radius around its location but be undetectable in other areas?

Our platform provides the most accurate information available based on mobile search results, specific zoom levels, and location restrictions. It's important to note that replicating these exact search parameters independently may be challenging.

For Google Maps results, we retrieve a maximum of 20 listings per search. If a business does not rank within the top 20 for a specific area, it will appear as a blank red entry on the map. Additionally, we do not include paid or sponsored listings in organic data reports. Please keep the following in mind:

- Organic search results do not utilize a radius setting.

For instance: If a search is conducted from a location 8.5 miles away from the business and the keyword falls outside of the business's top 20 results in that area, the location may display as a red dot on the map. To obtain more detailed data, users may wish to adjust the zoom level to focus on a smaller area.
