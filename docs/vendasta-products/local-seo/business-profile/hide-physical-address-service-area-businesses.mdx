You have the option to hide your physical business address in Listing Sync Pro, Citation Builder, and Listings Grade in the Snapshot Report. Clients will be able to list their business as a "Service Area Business" rather than a service in one physical location. This feature is also available as a "Bulk Update" action.

Partners will be able to accommodate existing and prospective clients who run service area businesses. These businesses offer local services without a physical location, such as those that offer mobile or online services, operate from home, or use third-party locations. Service area providers will now be able to accurately sync their listings with sources that support a hidden physical address, which will result in a more accurate listing score. This will also improve the accuracy of the listing grade in the snapshot report for these businesses.

Certain listing sources do not currently support this feature. This will affect the number of Listing Sync Pro sources that show up as available to sync with, in Local SEO. Though this will reduce the number of sources that are available to sync with, it will not impact your listing score negatively.

### How Does it Work?

**When creating a new account in Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts:**

Under "**Business Profile**", check the box next to **Service Area Business (hide physical address)**. This can be found under the "Zip/Postal Code" field. This option will be set to Off by default.
