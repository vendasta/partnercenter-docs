### **What are Hours of Operation?**

Businesses with hours of operation past midnight can easily update their hours in the Business Profile on the Vendasta platform. Under the 'Hours' tab, clients can enter business hours like 11:00 am - 3:00 am in Local SEO's Business Profile or in Business App, or you may update their hours in Partner Center under Account Management.

Please note: Changes to hours typically occur quickly, but in some cases, hours can take 3-5 days to sync to Google. Please plan updates to hours accordingly.
