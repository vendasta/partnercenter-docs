## What is the Business Profile?

All Local SEO users have access to a **Business Profile** tab in the product. This tab gives you and your clients the ability to edit business profile data within the Local SEO product. We've also added exciting new fields and attributes such as Special Hours (Holiday hours) and category-specific Google attributes. We also have "More Hours" *available now* which allows you to set things like delivery hours, drive-thru hours, etc.

## How will syncing of the Business Profile work?

Any account with Local SEO, a Listing Sync Pro add-on, or Citation Builder can sync out Special Hours and category-specific Google attributes. These new fields can be found under the "Hours" and "More" tabs respectively. Special Hours is great for setting things like holiday opening hours and letting customers know about special exceptions to your regular opening hours. Google attributes allow businesses to share details about their business with potential customers. Adding these attributes can allow a business to show up in search results when people search for places with those attributes on Google Search and Google Maps. Since Google attributes are category-specific, your clients will see different sets of attributes.
