## What is the "More Hours" feature?

All Vendasta customers have access to "More Hours" found in the Business Profile tab in Local SEO. This tab gives you and your clients the ability to edit business profile data within the Local SEO product. The "More Hours" will display category-specific attributes, so for example, restaurant clients can now set things like delivery, drive-through, takeout, and pick-up hours.

Please note that this new syncing field can only be found in the Local SEO Business Profile tab. The remainder of business data can still be found and edited in Partner Center under **Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select specific account > Edit Business Profile**.

## How does "More Hours" work?

In the Business Profile tab in Local SEO, navigate to the "Hours" tab to view and manage "More Hours."
