# WordPress Debugging Basics

This guide will help you understand the basics of debugging WordPress sites to find and fix errors.

## Debug Logging

One of the most useful tools for debugging WordPress is enabling debug logging. This will log PHP errors to a file that you can review.

To enable debug logging:

1. Access your WordPress configuration file (wp-config.php)
2. Add or update the following code:

```php
// Enable WP_DEBUG mode
define('WP_DEBUG', true);

// Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);

// Disable display of errors and warnings
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
@ini_set('display_errors', 0);
```

Once enabled, PHP errors will be logged to the wp-content/debug.log file.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. White Screen of Death
If your site shows a blank white screen:
- Enable debug logging as described above
- Check your PHP error logs
- Temporarily deactivate all plugins to see if a plugin is causing the issue
- Switch to a default theme

### 2. 500 Internal Server Error
This usually indicates a server configuration issue or a PHP error:

- Check your PHP error logs
- Increase PHP memory limit in wp-config.php: `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');`
- Deactivate plugins one by one to identify the problematic one

### 3. Database Connection Issues
If you see a "Error establishing a database connection" message:
- Verify your database credentials in wp-config.php
- Check if your database server is running
- Make sure your database user has the proper permissions

## Accessing File Logs

You can access logs through the SFTP file manager:

A common place to find PHP error logs is in the logs directory or in wp-content/debug.log if you've enabled WP_DEBUG_LOG.

Here's an example of what PHP logs might look like:

## Using the File Viewer

The file viewer allows you to directly view and edit files on your server:

## Using the Staging Environment

It's always best to debug issues in a staging environment before making changes to your live site:

The staging environment is a copy of your live site where you can safely test changes without affecting your visitors.

## Tips for Efficient Debugging

1. **Work systematically**: Make one change at a time and test
2. **Document everything**: Keep track of what you've tried
3. **Check recent changes**: Did you recently update WordPress, themes, or plugins?
4. **Verify file permissions**: Incorrect permissions can cause unexpected errors
5. **Use version control**: If possible, use Git to track changes and revert if needed
