# Importing WordPress sites into Website Pro

To import your WordPress sites into Website Pro, follow these steps:

## 1. Create an Account

Go to the [Accounts](https://partners.vendasta.com/manage-accounts) tab in Partner Center and create an account for each of your clients. All you'll need is a single piece of business information—like their business name—and our system will find the rest. ([Instructions](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-operations/create-and-manage-accounts))

- If you are on any of the paid subscriptions, you can also import your accounts via the [Lists](https://partners.vendasta.com/action-lists/manage?marketId=default) tab in Partner Center. ([Instructions](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-operations/manage-lists))

## 2. Activate Website Pro

Select the account in Partner Center and activate Website Pro. ([Instructions](/vendasta-products/activate-products))

- You can use the Lists tab in Partner Center to do this for every account at once (if you're on a paid subscription).

## 3. Create a New Site

For each account in Partner Center, launch Website Pro and create a site. All you'll need is their name, tagline, and domain.

## 4. Migrate the Old Site

### Option A: DIY

Use a plugin like [All-in-One WP Migration](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) to migrate your WordPress sites. ([Instructions](https://help.websitepro.hosting/?p=302))

### Option B: Do It For Me

If you'd like Vendasta to migrate your sites for you:

1. Submit [this form](https://website-pro-migration.websitepro.hosting/) to provide us with key details about your migration.
2. A member of our Website Pro team will email you to begin the migration.
3. We'll move a copy of each site to Website Pro and put it on a temporary domain.
4. You'll repoint the domains and DNS records to Website Pro.
