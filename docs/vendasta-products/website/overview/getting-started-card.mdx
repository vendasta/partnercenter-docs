Website Standard and Pro users will see a section on the product's dashboard. This section has been designed to help guide users through all capabilities and important steps of setting up their website and building their eCommerce store.

This section includes a series of links to help a user navigate the product and serves as a checklist when building their website.

Depending on the plugins available on the website, the section will display three sections:

1. Set Up Store
2. Customize Your Site
3. Connect Analytics

At Vendasta, we're dedicated to helping local businesses thrive. In order for your clients to thrive with our Website product, it is important to make navigating WordPress as easy as possible.

### How does the Getting Started Card work?

Upon logging in to **Website Standard or Pro**, the user will see the new section on the **Overview page**.

If the site was created from one of Vendasta's 7 eCommerce templates (with Divi Builder and WooCommerce), the user will be prompted with three options: **Set up store, Customize your site, and Connect analytics**.

If a user creates a website from another template, specifically one that does not have Divi Builder, they will only be prompted to **Set up store and Connect analytics**. *This is because the customize your site card links specifically to Divi Builder customization options.*

### Set Up Store

When a user clicks **Set Up store** they will be provided with a variety of deep links that will take them to a section of WordPress to build their eCommerce store with WooCommerce. At the bottom, the user is provided with a link to a step-by-step guide to building their store.

*Note: If the WooCommerce plugin is not installed on the website, the user will be prompted to install the plugin.*

**Add products:** This link will take a user to the *Products tab* of WooCommerce where they can add their first, or a new product to their store.

The **Edit Store** button takes a user to the *Products tab* to make edits or add new products quickly.

### Customize Your Site

When a user clicks **Customize Your Site** they will be provided with a variety of links taking them to sections of the front and back end of WordPress to customize the design of their website. There is also a helpful guide linked at the bottom to give users a more detailed understanding of how to customize their website.

The **Edit My Site** button will take a user to the *Theme Customizer* to make any other edits to their site.
