**Q:** Is there any way I can convert a .zip to .wpress? I saved my website with the Duplicator plugin and downloaded the backup manually and it's imported into a .zip extension. Now I need to import my website and I am looking for an easier and faster way than All in One provides.

**A:** Unfortunately this is not possible however we can import the file manually following the steps mentioned in the link [**here**](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-website/manual-site-import).
