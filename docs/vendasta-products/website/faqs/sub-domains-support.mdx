There is no limit to the number of sub-domains allowed or supported by Website Pro, however, all sub-domains will be redirected to a single primary domain.

For example, a customer can decide to have:

- website.com (PRIMARY)
- portal.website.com
- portal2.website.com
- portal3.website.com
- ...
- ...
- portal100.website.com

All these sub-domains can be added to Website Pro, but you can only have **1 primary domain**. All secondary domains will redirect to the primary domain.

:::note Important things to note:
- The sub-domain CNAME DNS record has to point to **host.websiteprohosting.com**
- All the sub-domains will redirect to the primary domain.
- Each sub-domain cannot be configured to redirect to anywhere else other than the primary domain on WebsitePro.
- When setting up sub-domains, you would add only the subdomain portion as the host in your record.
