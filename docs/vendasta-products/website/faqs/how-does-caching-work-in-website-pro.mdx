### **What is caching?**

A web cache (or HTTP cache) is the temporary storage (caching) of web documents, such as HTML pages and images, to reduce server lag. For example, when you return to a page you've recently looked at, the browser can get those files from the cache rather than the original server, saving you time and saving the network the burden of additional traffic.

Caching static files reduces several systems between an end-user requesting your website and the delivery of the WordPress PHP files and, thus, speeds up your WordPress site load time. Caching can be implemented on several levels, and Website Pro has one level of caching implemented for you.

### **Website Pro built-in caching**

Website Pro has a reverse proxy layer implemented with Nginx. Nginx is very fast and has an efficient caching mechanism. 

This can make viewing your changes awkward, but **_you can skip the cache by adding any URL parameters to the address:_** [www.example.com/path/you/are/checking/?skip-cache](http://www.example.com/path/you/are/checking/?skip-cache). Or when updates are performed, site owners will need to clear the cache if they want their customers to see the changes Immediately. 

Currently, Website Pro caches all content that matches the following criteria for 1 hour:

- The response was ok (200 status code)
- GET or HEAD requests (so not posting content)
- No URL parameters:
  - So [www.example.com/foo/bar](http://www.example.com/foo/bar) matches
  - But [www.example.com/foo/bar?anything](http://www.example.com/foo/bar?anything) does not
- The request is not to the admin panel [www.example.com/wp-admin/anything](http://www.example.com/wp-admin/anything)
- The request does not have a cookie that shows they
  - Just posted the comment they're looking at
  - They are logged in
  - They have _wordpress_no_cache_ set
  - They have _wp-postpass_ set

WordPress Plugins can also implement some level of caching.

Finally, customers can also make changes/updates in the staging environment (only available for Website **_Pro_**), and when pushed to Live, the cache is cleared automatically.
