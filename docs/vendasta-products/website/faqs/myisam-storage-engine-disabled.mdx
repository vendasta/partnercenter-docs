At the moment the only storage engine supported by our databases is InnoDB, MyISAM is not supported, unfortunately. Therefore, the call being made by the plugin when downloading content will fail.

According to Google, our provider, this is a stability issue.  

## Is there a workaround?

You can investigate maybe manipulating the DB Table creation script to not use MyISAM, but to use InnoDB. 

This is a conversation you will need to have with the plugin/theme developer on the feasibility/validity of such a measure.
