## Short Answer
Yes, but you'll need an extension for larger migrations.

## Explanation
By default, the All-in-One WP Migration plugin has an upload limit of 64 MB. However, with the free extension, this limit increases to 512 MB.

In Website Pro/Standard, most pre-installed templates come with either a 64 MB limit or an unlimited upload limit, depending on the plugin version. For migrating larger sites, you'll need the **All-in-One WP Migration Unlimited** extension.

If this extension isn't already installed on your site, our support team can assist in setting it up to facilitate larger migrations.
