DNS Records are an important and necessary part of the web. You can learn more about them from the article [What are DNS records?](https://help.websitepro.hosting/?p=10)

To connect your domain to Website Pro, it must have either an **A Record** or a **CNAME**:

1. **A Records**
   - If an A Record is required then it should point to *34.149.86.124*
   - To link your primary domain you would use an A record.

2. **CNAME Records**
   - It is recommended that sites use a CNAME Record pointing to [host.websiteprohosting.com](http://host.websiteprohosting.com/)

You should also be aware that **CAA Records** (if present) can prevent Website Pro from obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate and securely serving traffic:

- You don't need one at all. If there is no **CAA Record** then any issuer can provide valid SSL/TLS certificates
- If you do want a **CAA Record** (which is more secure) then you must allow *letsencrypt.org* to be a certificate authority. Let's Encrypt is the certificate authority Website Pro uses to generate and renew SSL certificates.
