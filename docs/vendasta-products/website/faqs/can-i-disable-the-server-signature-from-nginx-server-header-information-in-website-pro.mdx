## Short Answer

No, the server signature cannot be fully disabled in Website Pro.

## Explanation

The server signature is included in the NGINX Server Header Information to hide the actual server and version details. This security feature helps protect websites by masking specific server information.

While it is not possible to completely remove the server signature, disabling it would result in a default version being displayed instead. This default version information is essential for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

Please note that the server signature is a global server configuration and cannot be turned off for individual sites.
