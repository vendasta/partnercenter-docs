Yes, this is possible. WordPress version can be downgraded/upgraded to another version for a specific account.

This will be done via a plugin called **WP Downgrade | Specific Core Version** and the plugin can be downloaded at [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-downgrade/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-downgrade/) for free.

Upgrading or downgrading the WordPress version is sometimes necessary if certain themes are not compatible with the current WordPress version, which is why some features of the theme (e.g Visual Composer Page Builder with Drag and Drop layout, WP-Bakery page builder, etc.) won't work with a specific version. Hence the need to upgrade or downgrade to another version.
