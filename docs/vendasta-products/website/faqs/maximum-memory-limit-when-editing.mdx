If your site is constantly hitting the maximum memory limit when trying to edit (either in Divi Builder or Elementor) it may be an issue with the number of revisions. ***Be sure to back up the site before reviewing the number of revisions.***

The WordPress Sweep plugin can help to clear the post revisions.

Sometimes clearing the post revision of the Elementor theme is not enough and the PHP log notification to increase WordPress maximum memory may still persist. This could be caused by some plugins that conflict with the theme. This can be easily resolved by disabling the plugins to see which ones are in conflict. Some of the plugins that have been discovered to have conflict issue with Elementor are listed below:

- MetaSlider
- Photo Gallery
- Recent Posts Widget With Thumbnails
- Simple Custom Post Order
- Smart Grid Gallery
- Testimonial Rotator
- Unbounce Loading Pages
- WordPress Importer
- WP-Optimize - Clean, Compress, Cache
- WP Responsive Menu

If none of the listed plugins is installed, disable the existing plugins one at a time to discover the plugin causing the issue.
