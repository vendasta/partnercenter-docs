To change a user's WordPress role (from Administrator) you have two options.

### **Option 1**

**Create User in Business App – then change the role**

Once you have created a Business App user, log in to WordPress as that user. Once you are in the WordPress dashboard, go to:

- **Users > Role**

### **Option 2**

**Create User in WordPress (with matching email as Business App user) – then change the role**

Create a WordPress user within WordPress with the same email you will use for the Business App user. To change the user role of that user in WordPress, go to:

- **Users > Role**
- Note: **emails must be the same**. For example, if Bob is a WordPress user with the email robert@email.com, the Business App user that gets created for Bob must use robert@email.com and not bob@email.com. If you create a Business App user for Bob with the email bob@email.com, a new WordPress user will be created for Bob with bob@email.com, and Bob will now have two WordPress users.
