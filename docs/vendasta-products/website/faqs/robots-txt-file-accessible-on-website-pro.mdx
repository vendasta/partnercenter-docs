The `robots.txt` file is a text file that web crawlers request from sites to verify whether the site can be indexed. This is typically used by search engines. 

You may ask, why is the `robots.txt` file not accessible for the default domain of a site e.g mywebsite.websitepro.hosting. 

The `robots.txt` file is not accessible on the default domain (e.g. *mydomain.websitepro.hosting*), and the staging domain (e.g. *mydomain-staging.websitepro.hosting*), of a site for white-labeling purposes. 

By comparison, the file is accessible when accessed from the default domain of a site (e.g [https://www.mydomain/robots.txt](https://www.mydomain/robots.txt))
