description: How to resolve access denied errors when importing .sql files in PhpMyAdmin for Website Pro
---

In order to resolve the error above simply:

- Remove all *CREATE TABLE* commands in your .sql file
- In your **USE** command, reference the already existing databases (i.e. either the staging or production database depending on which you are running your script against)

**__Please Note__**: You will not be able to create databases in Website Pro, but can only make use of the two existing databases (1 for staging and 1 for production) already available for your use.
