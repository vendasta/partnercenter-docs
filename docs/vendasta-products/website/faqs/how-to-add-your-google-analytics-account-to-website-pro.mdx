In Google Analytics, a tracking code (JavaScript Code gtag.js) tracks the activity of a website user by collecting data and sending it to the analytics module. The code is generated automatically and has to be installed on each page of the website you want to track.

[Sign up](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) for Google Analytics and configure it for your site, or just log in if you've already completed that step.

1. Click [Admin](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368)

2. Select your site's account from the menu in the *ACCOUNT* column

3. Select a property from the menu in the *PROPERTY* column

4. Under *PROPERTY*, click **Tracking Info > Tracking Code**. Your [tracking ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977) is displayed at the top of the page

You can add the tracking ID directly to the code. If you are in the WordPress dashboard, select "Divi" from the left-hand side. Any code you place here will appear in the body section of all pages of your blog. This is useful if you need to input a tracking pixel for a state counter such as Google Analytics.
