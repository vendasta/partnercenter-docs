**Yes,** this is possible but there can also be some adjustments to consider afterwards as some features available in Squarespace might not be readily available in WordPress if the website is exported from Squarespace as a WordPress website.

## Step 1

Log in to your Squarespace account and go to the **Settings > Advanced > Import/Export menu.**

WordPress will now fetch and install the importer for you. Once finished, you need to click on the **Run importer** link to continue.
