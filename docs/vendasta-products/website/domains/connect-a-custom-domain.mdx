# Connect a Custom Domain

To connect a custom domain, follow these steps:

## Part 1: Your domain and its Records

1. Purchase a domain from a Domain Registrar.
2. Find the Domain Registrar's page for managing the DNS Records of your new domain
3. Edit or create a DNS Record for your new domain 
   - We recommend setting a CNAME Record with a value of *[host.websiteprohosting.com](http://host.websiteprohosting.com/)*
   - If you require an A Record then the value should be ***34.149.86.124***

## Part 2: Configuring your Website Pro Site

1. Log into Website Pro and navigate to the **Domains** tab
2. Click **Connect a Domain**
3. Enter the domain name you purchased. Click **Add Domain.**
4. Website Pro will mark the new domain as **Pending** while it verifies that the DNS records are correct. Once the DNS records have been verified (Website Pro checks for this automatically), your domain will show as **Connected.**
5. You will receive an email and see a notification in the **Recent Activity** stream of **Business App**.
6. You can also **Delete** added domains from this tab.
7. Once it has been **connected** requests for your new domain will be redirected to the **Primary Domain**.

You have the ability to set any of your **connected** domains to be the **Primary Domain**.

1. On the **Domains** tab
2. Find the domain in the list, expand the options menu on the right side, then click **Make Primary**.
3. All of your domains will then redirect to this domain.
