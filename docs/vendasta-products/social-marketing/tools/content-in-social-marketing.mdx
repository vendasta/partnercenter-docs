# Content in Social Marketing

The **Content** section functions like an RSS feed. It allows your clients to conveniently discover and re-publish interesting and relevant content using the share button.

You can find the Content section by navigating to the **Tools** tab of Social Marketing.

You can set up relevant content searches in the **Settings** > **Interesting Content** tab to control what is populated here.

To search our library of RSS feeds your clients can select the **Search** button, or to add an RSS feed that isn't in our system, they can also select **Add**. From here they can add in the relevant feed URL and give it a name and category assignment.
