# Clickable Bio for Instagram

The Clickable Bio feature in Social Marketing helps your clients drive traffic from Instagram to their website, products, or any other links they want to showcase.

## What is Clickable Bio for Instagram?

Clickable Bio is a feature that allows Instagram users to create a page with multiple links that can be accessed from their Instagram profile. Since Instagram only allows one clickable URL in the bio section of a profile, Clickable Bio solves this limitation by providing a single link that leads to a page with multiple links.

## How to Create a Clickable Bio

1. From your client's Dashboard, navigate to Social Marketing > Compose.

2. Select the Instagram account you want to create a Clickable Bio for.

3. Click on the **Clickable Bio** tab.

4. Paste the URL you want to add to the bio:
