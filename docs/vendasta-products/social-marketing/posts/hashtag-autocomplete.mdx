Social Marketing users have the ability to easily access their most recently used hashtags directly within the composer.

Adding relevant hashtags to social media posts is one way to increase that post's reach. On average, posts with hashtags perform 12% better than those with none. However, it can be time-consuming and challenging to keep track of every hashtag used. Many social media users have to copy and paste their desired hashtags from a list outside of their social media management software.

### How does hashtag autocomplete work?

Once in the Social Marketing composer, users will type **#,** and their most recently used hashtags appear.

Users can then select their desired hashtag. If the hashtag they are looking for doesn't appear in the *initial* drop-down menu, they can start typing the first few letters of the word and it will appear.

If they have not used the specific hashtag in a previous post they will need to manually type the hashtag out. Once that post has been scheduled/posted, it will appear in the hashtag list next time they make a post.

All Social Marketing users have access to this feature.
