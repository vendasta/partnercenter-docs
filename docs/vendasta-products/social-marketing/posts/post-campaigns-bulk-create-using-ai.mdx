### What are Post Campaigns using AI?

Craft posts **in bulk** with AI to create entire social campaigns in minutes! Generate text and imagery for multiple posts and social channels from a single AI prompt, customize by account, and schedule in a three-stage progression.

1. Provide a prompt and an image keyword. Select the social networks you would like to post to, the post quantity, length, and tone.
2. Review AI-generated text and imagery, and customize by account if desired.
3. Schedule posts or save them as drafts.

### How Does Bulk Creating Social Posts Using AI Work?

Step 1 - From the Overview page in Social Marketing, click **Create > Post Campaign.**

Step 2 - Enter the details in the first step of the form to generate posts. Post quantity can be selected as up to five at one time.  
**Note - Under 'networks', only connected accounts will be shown.**

Step 2a - Choose from text and images, or just text. Use only one word for the image keyword when text and images are selected.

Step 3 - In step 2 of the form, you can edit, customize, and save the content and the media by selecting the pencil icon.

Step 4 - When selecting images and text, if the image keyword does not generate an image there is a placeholder and users can select media by clicking the pencil icon.

Step 5 - Instagram needs an image before you can make a selection and go to step 3 of the form.

**Please note:** Clicking back to step 2 of the form will take you back to step 1, which will restart the post-creation process.
