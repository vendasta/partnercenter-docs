### **What are carousel posts?**

When composing a post for Instagram, users are able to add multiple images and videos then publish them as new posts, schedule them for a later time, or save the post as a draft. While composing a post and selecting media, the user can now sequence the media while in a single location composer to avoid manual efforts of removing and rearranging.

### **Why are carousel posts important?**

Being able to add multiple images and videos helps make the content more discoverable to the wider Instagram community and allows the business to grow its audience. Being able to sort the images and videos improves the process and reduces the time to create new posts.

### **How do carousel posts work?**

**Step 1:** Select Instagram or another connected network to post new content
**Step 2:** <u>Only 10 images</u> or videos can be selected at once *(this is the maximum allowed from IG)*. Multiple images can be selected by clicking on them.
**Step 3:** If posting only to Instagram, images, and videos can be combined for the selection
**Step 4:** Network-based validations are in place
**Step 5:** Images with errors will be highlighted with a red box as shown below:
