Artificial intelligence has been integrated into the social posting functionality in Social Marketing to allow users to quickly create AI-generated images by entering text prompts. This is in addition to the [AI-generated posting feature](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-social-marketing/vendasta-products-social-marketing-posts/ai-generated-posts-in-social-marketing) already introduced. This feature works for accounts with **Social Marketing Pro**.

Please note that this has been released to all Partners as of March 29, 2023. During this phase, the team has identified that some of the images generated using AI have been lower quality than the expected high standards. This is due to the Beta version on the provider side so a new badge will be added to indicate that Beta status of this release. 

To avoid quality-related issues, provide more detailed prompts for better results as shown below.

### **Why are AI-generated images important?**

**Is there are any limits on the number of posts or images the AI feature can make in Social Marketing?**

There are no limitations for content, but regarding images, we can include up to 3 images per request. This means we have the flexibility to create a post that includes both text and up to 3 images, all based on the topic specified by the user.
