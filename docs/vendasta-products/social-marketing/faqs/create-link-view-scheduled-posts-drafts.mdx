From the calendar, Social Marketing users can now create links to show drafts with scheduled dates, scheduled posts, or both.

This link allows you to easily review posts, share with individuals that don't have access to Social Marketing, or send to your clients for approval.

## How do you create a link to view scheduled posts and drafts?

1. Go to **Social Marketing > My Posts > Calendar.**
2. Click **Create report.**
3. Choose the types of posts to include.
4. Choose the time range to select posts from.
   - By default, posts scheduled to go out in the next 30 days will be selected.
5. Click **Create report.**

6. Copy the URL or open it in a new tab.
   - Be sure you store it somewhere safe as you won't be able to see the URL again once you've closed the dialog modal

**Please note that showing draft posts with scheduled dates is only available from the Calendar. These options are not available from the Scheduled posts page when creating the shareable link.**
