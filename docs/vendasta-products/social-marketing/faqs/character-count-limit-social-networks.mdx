Composer validations and character count are customized to ensure posts are consistent with each social network's requirements. This helps prevent failed posts by alerting the user to problems before posting.

### **Why is character count important?**

When creating social posts across different social providers, it is important that the content meets the requirements of each social media platform so that it posts correctly and successfully.

### **How does character count work?**

When using Composer to create a new post, the character count is displayed along with the total number of available characters. See the examples below.
