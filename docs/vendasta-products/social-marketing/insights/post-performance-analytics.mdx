Social Marketing users can view advanced analytics on the performance of their social media posts. This feature makes it easier than ever to monitor and grow a presence on the most important social networks for every business.

Users will find detailed insights into the success of their posts on Facebook, X, Instagram, and LinkedIn under the new **Insights > Post Performance** tab in Social Marketing. 

Social Marketing users will be able to see the engagement and reach of their social media content over time, as well as a detailed breakdown of the views, reactions, comments, shares (and more) that their posts receive. 

### Why is Post Performance Analytics in Social Marketing important?

When a Partner or a client wants to prove the effectiveness of their social media content, they can analyze and dig into social media post performance using the tool of their choice, so they can present the data as it suits best them using the date range of their choice.

### How does Post Performance Analytics in Social Marketing work?

Go to the Social Marketing Overview Page: 

Note that the middle card "Recent posts" has replaced the "Reach and Engagement" card. It displays only successful posts made during the last 30 days.

Next visit the **Post Performance** tab under **Insights.** Under the "All" tab, users can select different date ranges. After selecting the date range, users will see that the New posts count in the chart matches the total posts count in the table below.

Also under the "All" tab, users will see the published information, the post that was made, and the service used. There is an "Export" button to download a CSV file for this Post Performance reporting.
