Team plan administrators can easily manage members of their organization from the Users overview page ([https://app.calendarhero.com/org/manageusers](https://app.calendarhero.com/org/manageusers)).

Once the user gets deleted, the seat can be assigned to a new user by having the new user log in to the Business App and try to access CalendarHero.

*On a side note: Deleting the user* will remove the member from your organization AND completely delete their user account. This cannot be undone, and all associated data (such as meeting type settings) will be permanently deleted so we recommend proceeding with caution.
