# Can Vendasta CalendarHero accounts sign in to CalendarHero directly?

Yes! Once a CalendarHero account has been created by logging into the **Business App > CalendarHero**, clients will be able to access the same CalendarHero account when they log into CalendarHero directly, as long as they sign in with a Google or Microsoft account that has the same email address as the account they set up in the Business App.
