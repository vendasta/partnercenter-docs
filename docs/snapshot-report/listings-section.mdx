# Understanding the Listings Section in Snapshot Report

The Listings section of the Snapshot Report provides valuable information about a business's online presence across various directories and platforms. This guide explains how to interpret and use this section to help improve a business's online visibility.

## Listings Section Overview

The Listings section displays how accurately and consistently a business is listed across the web. It shows:

- The overall listing score
- How many directories include the business
- The accuracy of the business information across these listings
- Detailed information about specific listings

## Listing Score

The Listing Score indicates how well the business is performing with its online listings. This score is based on two primary factors:

1. **Listing Presence**: How many directories list the business
2. **Listing Accuracy**: How accurate and consistent the business information is across directories

## Listing Presence

The Listing Presence section shows how many directories include the business across the web. A higher percentage means the business is listed in more directories, increasing its visibility to potential customers.

## Listing Accuracy

The Listing Accuracy section displays how accurate and consistent the business information is across different directories. Inconsistent or inaccurate listings can confuse customers and hurt search engine rankings.

## Why Listings Matter

### Improved Search Visibility
Consistent, accurate listings help businesses rank better in search results. Search engines like Google trust businesses with consistent information across the web.

### Customer Trust
Accurate listings ensure customers can find the right information about a business, including contact details, hours of operation, and location.

### Competitive Advantage
Businesses with better listing presence and accuracy stand out from competitors, making them more likely to be found by potential customers.

## How to Use This Information

1. **Identify Missing Listings**: Look for important directories where the business is not listed
2. **Correct Inaccuracies**: Note any inconsistencies in business information across directories
3. **Prioritize High-Impact Directories**: Focus first on the most important directories for the business's industry
4. **Track Improvements**: Use regular Snapshot Reports to monitor progress as listings are added or corrected

## Next Steps

After reviewing the Listings section, consider these actions:

- Use Vendasta's Listing Distribution product to automatically sync business information across directories
- Create a plan to add the business to missing directories
- Correct any inaccurate information found in existing listings
- Schedule regular checks to ensure listing information stays accurate as the business evolves
