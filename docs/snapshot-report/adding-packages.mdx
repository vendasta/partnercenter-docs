As a visual representation of online performance, Snapshot Reports can be an effective way to engage with your clients. As they actively take in the details of the report, it's a great opportunity to encourage them to take specific actions, such as contacting their assigned salesperson or to schedule a meeting.

In addition, we've given you the ability to direct your clients straight to the packages and services you offer. This is a great way to draw their attention to your solutions without having to go through a salesperson, and is ideal if you offer any free versions as they'll be able to use them almost immediately.

### Adding packages from Partner Center

To enable package call-to-actions within the Snapshot Report from Partner Center, go to **Administration > Customize > Sales > Edit Default Snapshot Template**.

![Package admin customize](/img/snapshot-report/adding-packages/package-admin-customize.jpg)

Locate the specific section you'd like to enable a package for. Scroll down to the bottom of that section until you see **Edit Message**.

![Edit message](/img/snapshot-report/adding-packages/edit-message.jpg)

Below the call-to-action button, click **Edit primary button**.

Here you can change the button text and where it directs your clients. Select **Package**, and with the drop down menu choose the specific package you'd like your client's to click through to.

You can only add packages and services that have been added to your store from the marketplace.

Click **Save**, and from now on when a Snapshot Report is run in Partner Center that button will take the client to the selected package or service.
