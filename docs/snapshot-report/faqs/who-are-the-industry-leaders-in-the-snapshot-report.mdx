The **Industry Leaders** section of the Snapshot Report highlights the top-performing businesses within the Vendasta platform that share the same primary business category as the business the report is generated for.

### **Key Details About Industry Leaders**

- **Same Business Category**: Industry leaders are identified based on their primary business category, ensuring the comparison is relevant and meaningful.
- **Proximity Not Considered**: The selection of industry leaders does not factor in the geographic location or proximity to the business the report is created for.

This feature is designed to give an overview of top performers in the industry, providing valuable benchmarks for success.
