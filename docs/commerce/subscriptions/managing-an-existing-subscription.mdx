# Managing an Existing Subscription

Once subscription-based products have been configured and sold, you can modify the subscription price, add or remove products from the subscription, and cancel subscriptions.

## Billing Settings

When viewing a specific subscription from an account, **Billing Information** is displayed that was specified when creating a subscription. In some cases, you may need to edit this information to match an updated credit card, or to switch the payment method entirely.

### Default Settings
By default, subscriptions are billed automatically using the pre-configured payment processor on the first day of the billing cycle.

### Account-Level Settings
You also have the option to configure specific settings for handling the subscription at the account level.

## Editing Subscription Prices

You can edit the subscription price at any time during a subscription. The platform will display when the new price will come into effect—changes do not apply to the current billing cycle.

To edit a subscription price:

1. Find the subscription in **Commerce** > **Subscriptions**
2. Click on the subscription you want to modify
3. Click the **EDIT PRICE** button next to the current price
4. Enter the new subscription price in the relevant fields
5. Click **SAVE**

A price change icon will appear next to the price on a subscription, indicating that a price change will occur on the next billing cycle.

## Cancelling a Subscription

You can cancel a subscription at any time. When cancelling, you have two options:

### Cancel at End of Period
This option will allow the subscription to remain active until the end of the current billing cycle.

### Cancel with a Custom Date
This option allows you to specify a specific date when the subscription should end.

When cancelling a subscription, you will need to select which products you wish to cancel. This allows you to keep some products active while cancelling others if needed.

## Adding Products to a Subscription

To add more products to an existing subscription:

1. Navigate to the subscription in **Commerce** > **Subscriptions**
2. Click on the subscription you want to modify
3. Click **ADD PRODUCTS**
4. Select the additional products to add
5. Configure the product settings as needed
6. Click **SAVE**

Newly added products will be prorated for the remaining time in the current billing cycle.

## Removing Products from a Subscription

To remove products from a subscription without cancelling the entire subscription:

1. Navigate to the subscription in **Commerce** > **Subscriptions**
2. Click on the subscription you want to modify
3. Find the product you wish to remove
4. Click the menu icon (three dots) next to the product
5. Select **Remove**
6. Confirm the removal

Removing products follows the same cancellation rules as cancelling a subscription—you can choose to remove the product at the end of the billing period or on a specific date.
