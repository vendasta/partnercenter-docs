## Issue Credit Notes

Credit notes are documents issued by merchants to their customers to decrease the amount on a due or paid invoice. This may be necessary due to a mistake on an order or invoice, or to refund an amount paid for products or services. In the context of Vendasta Partner to client transactions, a credit note acts as the opposite of an invoice, reversing the amount owed by the client to the Partner.

## Common Reasons to Issue Credit Notes

- Accidental over-billing of a customer.
- Compensating the customer.
- Customer requested a refund.
- Offering a discount on a due or paid invoice.

## Types of Credit Notes

For a due invoice, **Adjustment Credit Notes** reduce the amount due to be paid. For already paid invoices, **Refundable Credit Notes** can be used to make a pay back to the client bank account. Credit notes also help maintain a record of all such reverse transactions for reporting and reconciliation.
