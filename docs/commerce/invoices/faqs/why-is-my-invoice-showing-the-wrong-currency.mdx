description: Understanding why an invoice might display in an unexpected currency.

If the invoice appears in a different currency than expected, it's possible that the invoice was **duplicated**. When an invoice is duplicated, it retains the currency of the original invoice along with the same line item values.

If you create a new invoice from scratch, the default currency will be **CAD**, which can be identified by the **"CA$"** prefix in the dollar values.

### How to Differentiate Between CAD and USD

- **CA$**: Indicates the invoice is in **CAD (Canadian Dollars)**.  
- **$ (without "CA")**: Indicates the invoice is in **USD (US Dollars)**.
