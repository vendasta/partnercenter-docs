*The Recurring Invoice functionality has been discontinued for new Partners. Please familiarize yourself with the enhanced [Subscription Billing](/commerce/commerce-invoices/subscription-billing) feature, which has been introduced as a replacement.*

There are multiple options to collect payment with the invoicing solution.

- **Create an invoice, but don't send to the customer:** This option creates the invoice and saves it on the platform as a draft. You can reference the invoice and manually send it to the customer for payment.

- **Email invoice:** With this option, the platform generates and emails the invoice to the customer to pay. Upon receiving the invoice by email, the customer can enter their credit card details to complete the payment.

- **Collect payments automatically:** Finally, this option automatically charges the customer's credit card on file. For this option, you will need to save the customer's credit card details as a payment method on file.
