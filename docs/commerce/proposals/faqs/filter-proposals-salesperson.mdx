## Why is adding a Salesperson to my Proposal important?

Managing multiple opportunities simultaneously is challenging. Proposal Builder helps salespeople stay on top of how close each of their opportunities is to close with status tags that show which proposals have been viewed, commented on, or approved in one view (the **Manage Proposals** dashboard).

With the filtering capability, salespeople can view their proposals without having to scroll through colleagues' proposals to pick out theirs.

## How does adding a Salesperson to a Proposal work?

1. Go to **Partner Center > Commerce > Proposals.**
2. Press the filter icon to the left of the **Search** bar to open the filter settings. 
3. Select a **Salesperson** from the dropdown.
