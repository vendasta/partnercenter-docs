# How often will I receive payouts?

Your payout schedule is determined by Stripe and is based on your location, currency, frequency of transactions, and other criteria.

You can expect your first payout within **7 business days** of receiving your first payment. This delay allows Stripe to mitigate some of the risks inherent in providing credit services after which payouts will occur on a regular schedule of **between 2 and 7 business days**, depending on the criteria mentioned above.
