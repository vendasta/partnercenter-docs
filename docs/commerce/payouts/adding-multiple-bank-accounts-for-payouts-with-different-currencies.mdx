# Adding multiple bank accounts for payouts with different currencies

In some countries, you can add extra bank accounts to enable settlements and payouts in additional currencies. You can add one bank account per supported settlement currency. If you use multiple bank accounts, you must select a default settlement currency, which you can change at any time.

Payments received in any enabled payout bank account currency will settle without currency conversion, however, payments presented in a currency that you haven't configured an additional bank account for will automatically convert to your default currency.

For example, consider a user in the United Kingdom who has added both GBP and USD bank accounts, with GBP selected as the default settlement currency. USD payments (where USD is the presentment currency) are automatically paid out to the USD bank account without conversion, payments in GBP are paid to the GBP account, whereas payments in all other currencies are converted into GBP and paid into the GBP account.

Refer to [Change Bank Account for Payouts](/commerce/commerce-payouts/change-bank-account-for-payouts) on changing the bank account to receive payouts for steps on adding additional bank accounts.
