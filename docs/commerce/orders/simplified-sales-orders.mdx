The new simplified sales orders workflow improves the sales order process, providing a consistent and efficient experience for both Salespeople and Administrators. This update reduces the time spent on administrative tasks, allowing Salespeople to focus on selling while giving Administrators more flexibility to manage orders.

With simplified sales orders, you'll notice:

- **Draft State for Sales Orders**: Start orders as drafts, so progress is saved automatically.
- **Reduced Steps**: Minimized steps to complete an order.
- **Autosave Functionality**: Your work saves as you go.
- **Instant Visibility**: Order Forms and Work Orders appear in their respective tabs immediately upon product selection.
- **Enhanced Validation**: Easily see what's required before submitting an order.
- **Bulk and Line-by-Line Edits**: Apply contract terms across the order or individually.

## New Admin Actions

- Submit drafts directly.
- Duplicate or cancel orders within the order workflow.
- Perform key actions without needing to impersonate a Salesperson.
- Admins without "can manage order" permissions can now perform all Salesperson actions, such as viewing and editing orders.

## How to Use This Feature

**Create a Sales Order**

1. From a company profile page, click on **Orders** and select **Create Order.**
2. Alternatively, go to **Commerce > Orders** and click **Create Sales Order** at the top.

This streamlined process:

- Saves time by reducing administrative steps.
- Improves collaboration between Salespeople and Administrators.
- Ensures all necessary information is available upfront, minimizing errors.
- Makes order management more flexible and efficient.
