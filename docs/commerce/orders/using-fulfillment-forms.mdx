# Using Fulfillment Forms

Fulfillment Forms are used for obtaining additional details from a customer to complete the order. When you create an order in Partner Center, there is a Fulfillment Form section where you can select a form to be filled out and submitted to receive the information needed to fulfill the order.

## Completing the Form

1. When the order is submitted, the customer will receive an email and notification with a link to the fulfillment form.
2. After clicking on the form link, the customer will be taken to a page where they can complete the form:

3. The customer must complete all required fields in the form before submission. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).

## Submitting the Form

After completing all the required fields, the customer can click the Submit button at the bottom of the form.

1. Click the "Share" button at the top of the form
2. Enter the email address of the person you want to share the form with
3. Click "Share"
