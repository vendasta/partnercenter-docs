description: Information about the customer statement description shown on credit card statements
---

The customer statement description that you set when setting up Vendasta Payments is shown on your customers' credit card statements and is used to clarify a payment they have made for your products or services.

Using a clear, accurate, and recognizable statement descriptor reduces the likelihood of chargebacks and disputes, as it helps your customers to remember where a particular charge or payment originated from.
