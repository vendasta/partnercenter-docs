Partners [using Vendasta Payments](/commerce/commerce-payments/vendasta-payments) can be notified in-platform when one of their clients pays an invoice or makes a purchase via the [Shopping Cart](/commerce/commerce-payments/shopping-cart). If a payment fails, Partners will receive a notification via email. Note that only [Partner Center Admin users](/commerce/commerce-payments/partner-center-admin) can receive these notifications.

Invoice and payment notifications can be set up or changed using the **Notification Settings** page in Partner Center.
