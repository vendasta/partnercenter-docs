## **Prospecting**

Here are some of the core steps you can take to kick off your prospecting efforts. This video showcases all of the steps for adding accounts, creating Snapshot Reports, and sending them all at once.

<iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2a58b4c3436a42838c44ea6eecb63a57?sid=07c18e31-3d9c-4164-abea-5b88d481b31c" width="100%" height="360" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>

## **Find and add accounts**

Accounts can be added in groups and individually. This workflow showcases how to add many accounts at once into a list. To learn more about adding individual accounts or importing them via a csv file, [**go here**](/partner-center/accounts/adding-accounts).

1. Go to [**Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts**](https://partners.vendasta.com/manage-accounts)
2. Click **Find accounts.**
3. Search for businesses by type or location. (For example, you could search for "Dentists near me").
4. Click the checkboxes next to any of the businesses that you want to prospect.
5. Click **Continue.**
6. Click **Create accounts.**
7. Wait a few moments for the accounts to be added as part of a list.

The system will grab information about these businesses right from their Google profile and add that information right into the platform for you. Some information is not readily available from a Google Business Profile, so you will still want to look for additional information about the business such as email addresses or contact names.

## **Create Snapshot Reports**

Snapshot Report is a needs assessment tool that will let you know about the gaps in the business's online presence. Because your prospects were added as a part of a list, you can create Snapshot Reports as part of a quick bulk action.

1. Go to **Partner Center > Accounts > Lists**
2. Click on the **⋮** vertical ellipsis menu next to the list you created.
3. Click on **Create/Refresh Snapshot Reports**
   - Note that additional charges may apply
4. Wait for information to start populating.
   - It can take up to 24 hours for the information to be fully populated and up to date.
   - The Snapshot Report will continue to refresh with information for 7 days from its creation.
   - Snapshot Reports can be refreshed after the 7 days–additional charges apply.

To create a Snapshot Report for one account, go to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts** click on the + report![Report icon](/img/getting-started/getting-started-guides/20439434749847.jpg) icon next to the account name.

:::tip
**Tip:** While waiting for information to populate, it's a great time to make some quick edits to the Snapshot Report. If you've added a number of prospects that are part of the same business category, you can flag them as competitors. Check out our [**Snapshot Guide**](/reports/snapshot-guide) for more.

Setting up connections for your customer in Business App is crucial for retention. Something as simple as connecting their Google Business Profile helps them to see value and increase functionality across many products and features.

To access the Business App Connections for your customer, follow these steps:

1. Go to Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts
2. Click on the **⋮** vertical ellipsis menu on the far right of the account in the table.
3. Click **Open Business App**.
4. Click **Settings**.
5. Click **Connections.**
6. Click **+** next to the app or external account you wish to connect.

From here, there may be some different steps depending on the connection you wish to make, but in general you or your customer will need their login credentials and will need to give permission for information to be shared with Business App (often shown as an unbranded app called Social Reputation).
