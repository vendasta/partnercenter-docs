## Invoice your customers

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: '0'}}>

</div>

You can send individual, one-off invoices to your clients. This is great for one-time charges, set up fees, and for collecting the initial payment for new services. To test Vendasta Payments for the first time and experience what your customers would experience, send yourself a $1 invoice and pay it. The money (minus fees) goes back to your account and you will have a good understanding to communicate to your clients.

1. Go to Partner Center > Billing > [Invoices](https://partners.vendasta.com/invoices)
2. Click Create Invoice
3. Select an account to which you will send the invoice
4. Select a user to whom the invoice will be sent (you can add users if there isn't one on the account yet)
5. Select a due date

   - When adding an item, start typing and it will search your catalog of products. As you type the name of the product, you can quickly add custom line items by clicking "Use as one-off line item"
   - When you add a package, you will have the option to make its contents visible or not. Essentially, showing each product in the package as an individual line item or not.
7. Add taxes
   - Add them to individual taxes to line items by clicking the menu icon along the line item.
   - Click Update default tax to select taxes that are applied to all items on the invoice
8. Add a memo line (optional)
9. Select collection type
   - You can email the invoice which will give your customer the opportunity to enter their credit card for the payment
