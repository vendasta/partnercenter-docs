# Getting Started with Projects in Task Manager

Task Manager is Vendasta's tool to help fulfillment teams to track and communicate the work they are doing for customers, and its flexibility and customization allows for a variety of workflows, all while fitting into Vendasta's infrastructure for ordering and reporting.

This guide will focus on using projects in Task Manager. Projects are an easy way to get started and allow for a lot of flexibility, no matter the work that's being done. Whether you're using an existing process that your team has used for years or you're starting something new from the ground up, Task Manager Projects can be the tool for you!

### Navigation Basics

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} 
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/8abebd4066d842b8932d92a137f83549?sid=9cf7fb82-279d-45c5-9703-4563480c3a47" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

You can access Task Manager from Partner Center by clicking **Tasks > Open Task Manager.** Additionally, by navigating to **Tasks > Users**, you can find your unique Task Manager login URL that you can provide for your Digital Agent users to log in directly.

The video above walked you through the basic navigation of Task Manager. Here are the main sections to be aware of:

**Projects:** The focus for this guide, projects are a collection of tasks. Typically, they represent the unit of work that your team is completing for a customer (eg. a Website Build, or a Customer Onboard for example). The Projects tab shows all of the open and completed projects for your entire team.

**Accounts:** Unlike the Accounts section in Partner Center, this section shows only accounts that have tasks or projects associated with them.

**Tasks:** The individual pieces of work that your team is completing for a customer. Projects are made of up tasks, but tasks can also be created as standalone items. This section allows you to view all of the tasks across your team.

**Templates:** Pre-built projects that can be manually or automatically created as needed.

**The Loop:** An activity feed of information inside of Task Manager. [Learn more.](/getting-started/getting-started-guides/the-loop-task-manager-updates-now-visible)

**Settings:** Adjust the settings for task generation, statuses, and more. [Learn more.](/getting-started/getting-started-guides/task-manager-global-settings-overview)

## Create a template

### Basic template

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} 
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/e9a4ed44d5e74d6c943b02059b02596d?sid=66ee804d-ddd4-4cf8-9b41-103c74c29e69" 
    frameBorder="0"

### Advanced template features

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} 
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/4ad83e9b2c04478d9c652e9f09ef6130?sid=1963c332-01cf-4481-b38e-499ecdee9074" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

There are several advanced features available when creating a template.

**Advanced Settings for Projects**

Clicking into the advanced settings in the main project configuration section while creating a template reveals two settings:

1. **Project details:** This rich text box allows you to add information that will be generated each time that a project is created from this template.
2. **Associate with items in Marketplace:** This will allow you to choose a product. Every time that you activate the chosen product, the templated project will be generated.

**Advanced Settings for Tasks**

When adding tasks to a project, there are advanced settings available here as well:

1. **Task notes**: There is a rich text field to add public and private task notes that will be generated inside of the task every time that a project is created from this template.
2. **Product**: You can select one of Vendasta's core marketplace products (eg. Reputation Management, Website Pro, etc). This will create a link to the product inside of the task that will allow your team to access that product inside of your customer's Business App.

**Locking Tasks/Task Dependency**

When you create two or more tasks, an option will become available to you to "Lock the next task until this one is completed." This allows you to prevent the task from being completed or acted upon until the previous one is completed. Note that when a task becomes locked, rather than setting a due date from the task's creation, you set a due date based on when the task is unlocked instead.

## Generate your project

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} 
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/cc90866e0dc14559b7a3b5908f9db4a4?sid=0e4c53ca-369a-4871-a470-5401088cd1d7" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

There are three ways that you can create a project from a template: **manually, through product activation,** and **through an automation.**

### Manual

1. Go to Task Manager > Projects.
2. Click "Addâ€¦" in the top right corner.
3. Click Project from the dropdown menu.

5. Use the "Import template" search bar and type in the name of your project template.

7. Search and select an account from the Account search bar in the form.
8. At this point, you may make any adjustments to the project or tasks that you wish.
9. Scroll to the bottom and click Create project.

### Product activation

You can generate a project from a template every time that you activate a Marketplace product of your choosing. When creating or editing a project template, you can follow these steps:

1. In the project template, click Advanced settings.
2. Under Associate with items in the Marketplace, search and select the product of your choice.
3. Scroll down to the bottom and save or update the template.

With a Marketplace product selected, every time that you activate this product for an account, the project will be launched in Task Manager for that account.

### Automation

2. Click Create Automation.
3. Select "From a template" or "Create a new automation".
   - If selecting "From a template" then choose "Create a new fulfillment project" as the template.

## Manage your projects

### General overview

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} 
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/7845e10e8a7d483db87d694845c79cbe?sid=d6c6d6df-5ead-4a66-a7cb-dd2fe99b0f6a" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

Once you have projects created, there are several powerful ways to track them. The video above walks through several of these. Here are the main points to take away:

**Projects page:** This is the main way to view your projects. Here you can create views (eg. "Overdue by assigned to", "Upcoming due projects for account X", etc) to easily group and monitor the status and due dates of your projects. 

**Account view:** When accessing an account, you'll be able to see all projects and tasks associated with that account. This allows you to quickly see everything happening for a specific customer.

**Inside projects:** Adding comments, attachments, updating statuses, and using the Due Date Estimator are all ways to efficiently manage your projects once they're created.

### Sharing projects in Business App

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0 }}>
  <iframe 
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} 
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/e13ef53e7c9a4dceb5a07a69f3feeb26?sid=b39f2f0a-9ef2-451c-802d-ad31c5f2d3ba" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allowFullScreen>
  </iframe>
</div>

Projects can be shared to Business App, so your customers can be kept up to date on the active projects that are being worked on for them. To enable this feature, take the following steps:

1. Go to Task Manager > Settings.
2. Go to the General tab.
3. Under Projects in Business App select Enable projects in Business App.
4. Click Add Project Type.
5. Add a name and (optionally) a description for your Project Type.
6. Now, when editing or creating a project, you can select your Project Type, which will allow you to display the project in Business App.

Note that if you select a project to be displayed in Business App, your customer will be able to see the entire project timeline including all tasks in the project, as well as any public comments in the tasks. Take care to ensure all information is appropriate to be shared with your customer.
