## Unbranded sales materials

In addition to the assets below, we highly recommend you check through the Screenshots & Files section of the products found in our [**Marketplace**](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products) for more sales and marketing materials and check out our [**Go-to-Market section**](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/categories/4406956995863-Go-to-Market).

## Customize your domains

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mszFStqeY5Q" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>

Completing and submitting [**the custom domain form**](https://custom-domains-form.websitepro.hosting/) ensures that your customers and salespeople will be able to access the different parts of the platform through a link that represents your brand, instead of a gray-label link. Once the form is submitted, our Support team will make updates in the back end and reach out with further instructions so that you can update your DNS records with your domain registrar.

## Configure your email settings

There are two places you will need to update your settings: Administration and Marketing. By completing this setup, you will ensure that the emails that are sent out from the platform have maximum deliverability and are being sent under your brand.

### Administration

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KzUkbP8uKYc" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>

Go to [Partner Center > Administration > Customize > Email Settings](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-design) and ensure that all of your email information and business contact details are accurate. 

Please note that in order to comply with anti-spam legislation, you will need to include a physical address here that will appear at the bottom of all of your emails. If this is left blank, your emails will not be sent out through the platform.

### Marketing Email Settings

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e4y-SSYhIkc" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>

Updating your email settings will ensure that the emails that are sent through the platform have maximum delivery. In [**Partner Center > Marketing > Email Settings**](https://partners.vendasta.com/email-settings) you will see that we have a default authenticated domain for you that we will use to ensure your emails are delivered.

1. Go down to **Sender domain**
2. Select **Use my own domain**
3. Click **Add domain**
4. Enter your domain
5. Click **Start authorizing domain**
6. Once you enter your domain, you will be provided with a list of records that will need to be added to your domain registrar. You will need to copy the values into the correct record types with your registar.
7. Note that once these have been added, it can take up to 72 hours for your domain to be fully authenticated.

If you need help with setting up your DNS records, we have additional information on this process for [GoDaddy](/hc/en-us/articles/4406961173655) and [Namecheap](/hc/en-us/articles/5326814195991). If you use a different domain registrar and you are still needing help, you can reach out to our support team.

</div>

For select products, you can change the name and icon to represent your brand.

2. Under **Product Info** turn on **White-Label Branding.**
3. Enter your desired product name and icon.
## Customize your customer experience

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z5iG0VxqoIQ" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>

Go to [Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Business App > Customize Business App](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-business-app/overview). This is your portal to customize and configure the customer experience including Business App name, default notifications, Business App page and connection access, and more. Walking through each section includes embedded resources that provide context and details on the settings you can update. Click through each page and check the settings to make sure they fit for the kind of customer experience you want to create.

Here are some things to keep in mind:

- The Customize Business App section will take you to other settings for the platform that your customer interacts with, so it can act as your one-stop area to adjust the whole customer experience.
- If you uncheck any of the "Show this page" checkboxes, then that page will not be shown to any Business App Users at all.
- Remember to hit the Save button after updating any of the settings in the different sections.
