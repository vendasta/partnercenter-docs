# What is an Account Group ID?

Account Group ID, or AGID is a unique identification code used to identify a business account that you have added to the platform; it is your client's unique ID in the platform. This code is referenced within the software and can be used when searching for accounts in a variety of places. Our support and development teams will sometimes need this code to ensure that they are referring to the correct business account.

### **Finding the AGID**

The AGID can be found under the Business Details section of the account in Partner Center. Navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select account**. You will see a box with the Business Details (name, address, phone number, etc.) In the bottom-right of this box is the AGID.

### **Using the AGID**

Primarily, you would be providing an AGID to Vendasta to help troubleshoot. You can use this when searching for a business on the platform. For example, if you are working with a business that has multiple locations, searching by name can be tricky, but searching by AGID will produce a singular result.

You can use an AGID to search accounts in Partner Center. You can also search by AGID when looking up tasks and projects in Task Manager.
