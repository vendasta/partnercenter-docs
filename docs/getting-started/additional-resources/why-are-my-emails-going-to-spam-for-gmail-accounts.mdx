# Why are my emails going to spam for Gmail accounts?

Unfortunately, this issue is typically client/email-specific. For example, a client may have a link in the footer of their review request. If it is removed, the email goes into the main Inbox.

Gmail maintains its process for spam filtering and doesn't give a lot of insight into why certain messages are filtered. They have [some guidelines](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en) for avoiding their spam filter.

Removing the link from the footer of the review request email caused the review request to land in my inbox rather than the spam folder.

This could be for two reasons:
1. Gmail is pretty sensitive to linking to pages that collect user information ([link](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6596#:~:text=Remove%20links%20to%20websites%20asking%20for%20personal%20information.)).
2. It's not unheard of that a spam filter evaluates emails based on the content of the page that is linked (to ensure that emails are not linking to malicious pages). The spam filter itself may be sensitive to linked pages containing information about firearms.

The easiest way to remedy this would be to edit existing CV templates to remove the link from the footer and see if this fixes the issue.
