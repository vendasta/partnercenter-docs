### **Product activation failed but my Partner was charged**

**Explanation:**

In the event that the product activation fails, our system will automatically initiate a refund for the failed products. For instant billed partners, the funds will appear in their bank account within 5 business days typically. 

For invoiced partners, the refund will be in the form of removing the failed product activation from their monthly invoice.

**Issue:**
The partner's credit card was charged the wholesale cost of a failed product activation.

**Fix:**

No fix is required.
1. Check **_Billing Center_** under **_Refunds_**
2. Once the refund has been issued, your partner can see it in **_Partner Center_** by going to **_Administration > Financial Documents > Credit Notes_**

### **Jim Salesman is showing on the email when I send a test**

**Explanation:**

The Jim Salesman salesperson contact card will appear when we don't select an account to impersonate on the test email. You can replicate real-life contact information by selecting an account from the menu at the top of the email preview in the text box that reads "Generic Account". Once an account is selected, you will see the new information in the preview email.

**Issue:**
Jim Salesman is showing as the Salesperson contact card instead of the partner's contact information.

**Fix:**

1. From the email preview select the **_Generic Account_** drop-down menu
2. Select the business you wish to replicate in the test email
3. You will now see the assigned salesperson's contact information on the test email

### **When to contact Marketing Support vs Support on-Demand**

**Explanation:**

Send a ticket to Support on-Demand if you are unsure where the best place to submit the ticket is, we will make sure it gets where it needs to be. however, there are some challenges when we get a ticket for Marketing Services. Marketing Services does not use the same system that Support on-Demand uses, this means that we can't just send the ticket to them to action. This can cause delays and loss of information in the transfer.

**Issue:**

Unsure who to contact about a Marketing Services related issue or question.

**Fix:**

1. Is this an error with the platform/product?
   - **support@vendasta.com**
2. Does this involve making changes to work Marketing Services is currently doing or will be doing in the future?
   - **support@yourdigitalagents.com**
3. Is there a reporting error or an error message blocking work, or does this feel like a bug?
   - **support@vendasta.com**
4. Is this communication/feedback/questions for the Marketing Services teams?
   - **support@yourdigitalagents.com**

**Resource:**

For more information on Marketing Services please reference the following section the the resource center.

### **Submitting a Support Ticket**

**Explanation:**

The more applicable information we have, the better our investigation will be, the fewer times we will have to reach out to you or the partner, and the quicker we can find an answer/escalate the problem. You know your partners and their processes and internal lingo much better than the Support Agents, we rely on you to relay the applicable information.

**Issue:**
Unsure on what to include in a Support on-Demand support request.

**Fix:**

For best results, please include the following information in the body of the ticket or request:

1. Partner ID
2. Account Group ID (if applicable)
3. User or team member affected (if applicable)
4. Replication Steps
5. Screenshots (or video) of error messages

These best practices are highly recommended when submitting a ticket to support.
