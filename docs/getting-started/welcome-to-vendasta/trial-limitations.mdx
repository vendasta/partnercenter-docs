## What is a trial?

A trial is a state that an account can be placed in that allows access to certain features of a higher subscription tier for a limited time.

### How to initiate a trial

1. From Partner Center (by clicking an in-platform call-to-action and starting a trial with no credit card necessary)
   - This starts a Premium trial for 14 days (for most partners) or 30 days (if referred by an affiliate)
2. By a Vendasta representative
   - Contact a Vendasta representative for assistance setting up a trial

## What features are limited while on Trial?

Some features, even while on a trial, may be limited or unavailable. Typically, these limitations are in place to protect against fraudulent activity.
