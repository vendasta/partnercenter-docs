# Opportunities

Opportunities are potential sales that are tracked in the CRM. You can create opportunities to track the progression of a sale from initial contact to closed deal.

## Accessing Opportunities

Opportunities can be accessed via the CRM section of the Business App.

## Opportunity Value Analytics

The CRM provides analytics on the total value of your opportunities, broken down by stage.

This visualization helps you understand your sales pipeline and forecast potential revenue.

## Managing Opportunity Stages

Each opportunity can be in one of several stages that represent its progression through the sales pipeline:

- **Lead**: Initial contact or expression of interest
- **Qualified**: The opportunity has been qualified as a potential sale
- **Proposal**: A proposal has been presented to the potential customer
- **Negotiation**: Terms are being negotiated
- **Won**: The opportunity has resulted in a sale
- **Lost**: The opportunity did not result in a sale

Moving opportunities through these stages helps you track your sales process and identify potential bottlenecks.
