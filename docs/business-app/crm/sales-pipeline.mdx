A sales pipeline mirrors your sales process, with each stage symbolizing a critical step toward closing a deal. While you can adjust stages whenever necessary, carefully designing a pipeline that aligns with your strategy is key. A well-structured pipeline not only provides clarity but also fosters consistent success, guiding your team through each essential phase of the sales journey.

### Setting Up Your Pipeline

When you visit the **Opportunities** page for the first time, you'll see the option to **Set up a pipeline**. Clicking this button creates a pipeline with default stages, which you can tailor to match your sales process.

In this setup, you have the flexibility to:

- **Add New Stages**: Click **Add Stage** to incorporate additional stages.
- **Remove Stages**: Remove stages that don't fit your process by clicking the "X" on each stage.

Stages are arranged according to their **Close Probability** to help forecast potential revenue by estimating the likelihood of closing deals at each stage. Note that **Closed Won** and **Closed Lost** are default stages, so they can't be removed, and additional stages cannot have a 0% or 100% Close Probability.

### Adding or Removing Pipelines

You can create multiple pipelines to support diverse sales processes:

- **Add a New Pipeline**: Click **Create Pipeline** to set up an additional pipeline. There's no limit to the number of pipelines you can create.

- **Remove a Pipeline**: To delete a pipeline, click **Delete** next to the pipeline. Make sure no opportunities are assigned to it, as any unassigned opportunities from a deleted pipeline will become unattached.

With these features, you can build a pipeline that accurately reflects your sales strategy, empowering your team to navigate each sales stage with precision and focus.
