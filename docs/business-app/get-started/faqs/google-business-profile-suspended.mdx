# What do I do if my Google Business Profile is suspended?

If your Google Business Profile (previously Google My Business) listing is suspended, the owner of the business must appeal the suspension directly to Google. Vendasta is unable to appeal suspended profiles on your behalf.

Google may suspend Business Profiles and user accounts that go against their guidelines. [Check Google's guidelines](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177).

### Fix a suspended profile

2. Sign in to Google Business Profile. Ensure your profile follows the guidelines. [Learn how to edit your profile](https://support.google.com/business/answer/3039617).
