# Setting Up SSO-Based Integrations

Vendasta provides seamless access to third-party applications through Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations. This allows you to connect your business clients' accounts with supported applications without requiring separate logins.

## Accessing the Connections Page

To connect a business with an integration:

1. Navigate to the Business App for the business client
2. Select the **Connections** tab in the left menu

## Setting Up a New Connection

### Step 1: Find the application

Browse through the available applications on the Connections page. Each application will display a marketing page with information about its features and benefits.

### Step 2: Click the Connect button

Click the **Connect** button on the marketing page to begin the connection process.

### Step 3: Complete the pre-connect form

Depending on the application, you may need to complete a pre-connect form with initial setup information.

### Step 4: Follow the SSO process

Complete the Single Sign-On connection process by following the prompts. This typically involves:

- Creating a new account with the third-party service
- Connecting to an existing account
- Providing authorization for data sharing
