# Orders in Business App

Your customers can view their orders in Business App which can help cut down on extra back-and-forth communication. The orders table allows Business App users to see what they've ordered, what they're spending, and any other associated information. This is especially useful for bookkeeping and transparency.

Viewing orders in Business App is easy:

1. Log in to **Business App**
2. Click **Orders**

From there, users can do a few things:

- Click into an order to see the contract start and expiration dates.
