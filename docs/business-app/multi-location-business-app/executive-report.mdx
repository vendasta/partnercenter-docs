![Multi-Location Executive Report](/img/business-app/multi-location/executive-report/executive-report.jpg)

The Multi-Location Executive Report is a powerful roll-up of metrics across any number of business locations. With a custom date selector and filtering, it's easy to slice the data to see trends in marketing performance across a Multi-Location Group.

Available in Multi-Location Business App and fully white-labeled, this report allows for powerful needs analysis and proof-of-performance reporting.

## Use it to prospect

Multi-Location Executive Report shows the marketing data that's been collected for all your business accounts. This means that you can run Snapshot Reports for a group of locations, and then view that data inside Multi-Location Business App to help users see opportunities for improvement.

## Use it for proof-of-performance reporting

Trend lines and delta-change numbers are a key feature of Executive Reporting, allowing you to show short or large-scale change across many accounts, and prove the impact your work has been having.

## Key Features

- **Fast data** – Slice-and-dice large data sets quickly.
- **Short-term changes and long-term trends** – Compare metrics period-over-period with a custom date selection.
- **White-labeled** – The report is your own, complete with your logo and branding.
- **Filtering** – Filter by geography, business category, region, groups of locations, or listing/review sources.
