## **What is Inbox in Multi-Location?**

For businesses utilizing Inbox Pro to manage communication across multiple locations, the Multi-Location Inbox feature offers a streamlined solution. Multi-Location Inbox aggregates all conversations from various accounts into a single Inbox. This enables teams to efficiently handle customer communication via Google Business Messages, Facebook, Instagram (Coming soon), SMS, and Web Chat conversations, all within one centralized platform.

## **Key Features**

**Easy Setup:** Users can opt-in to Multi-Location Inbox by clicking the "Start Using Multi-Location Inbox" button. This action pulls past and future conversations from all accounts within the group into a single, easy-to-access Inbox.

**Cross-Channel Messaging:** Multi-Location Inbox supports communication across all available channels, including Web Chat (Pro), Email, Lead Capture Forms, SMS (Pro), Google Business Messages, Facebook, and Instagram (coming May 2024).

**Closing and Opening Conversations:** Conversations can be seamlessly "closed" within Multi-Location Inbox, reflecting the status across single-location accounts as well.

**Mobile-Friendly:** The Multi-Location Inbox is designed to be mobile-friendly, allowing users to stay connected and respond to messages on the go.

**Please Note:** For teams managing communications across multiple locations, we recommend bookmarking the Multi-Location Inbox and keeping it open throughout the day to ensure prompt responses to incoming messages.

**Setting up AI-Assisted Web Chat for Franchise Websites**

For franchises with multiple locations, each with its team managing leads, installing a unique web chat widget on each location's website ensures separate lead and contact databases for each location. Alternatively, franchises with a centralized team can designate a single-location account as the "HQ" and install the Inbox web chat widget from that account to manage leads centrally.

## **How to Use Multi-Location Inbox**

1. Navigate to the desired multi-location group. 
2. Click **Inbox** - This is where you will be able to access a unified view of all conversations from all accounts within the group.
3. Select **Start using multi-location inbox** to get started!
