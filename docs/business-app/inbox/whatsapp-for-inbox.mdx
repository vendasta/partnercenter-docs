### Sending Messages Through WhatsApp

Once connected, businesses can send WhatsApp messages to customers using approved message templates.

**Key Notes:**

- Outbound messages are billed by Meta, not the Business App.
- If the WhatsApp Business account is new and lacks approved templates, the system will automatically submit one for approval. Additional templates can be created and submitted via the [Meta Business Help Center](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/).

### FAQs

**Q: Can a client connect an existing WhatsApp business account to Inbox, and still use the mobile app?**

**A:** Not currently, but in the future WhatsApp is looking to provide better support for this. The feature is called "WhatsApp Coexistence" and is currently in closed beta at WhatsApp.

If a business has a WhatsApp for business account on their phone already, they can register a new (second) account for using with Inbox. In the future, we hope to support 'coexistence' as well.

**Q: Why can't I write an outgoing message?**

**A:** WhatsApp business only allows approved templated messages to be cold-sent to users, and there is a small charge for these messages. Once a customer messages the business, you can write custom replies within a 24-hours window. Outside of this window, you can only send approved templated messages.

**Q: Why did my message fail to send?**

**A:** Your template may not be approved. You can check the status of approved templates in [https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/message_templates](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/404/?reason=waba_access)

**Q: What will WhatsApp messaging cost me?**

**A:** The first 250 (1,000 once verified) conversations each month are free so businesses can start to build experiences their customers will love. When they're ready to expand beyond 1,000 conversations per month, Meta's conversation pricing applies.
