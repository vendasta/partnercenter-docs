## FAQs

**Q: Why did my AI provide a certain answer?**

A: The AI will use facts and knowledge that it's been trained on. If an answer was incorrect, it's likely that the source training data was incorrect – the most common culprit is old or incorrect information found on the website.

**Q: How long does training take?**

A: Depending on the size of a website, and how many pages the AI is trained on, it may take 1-5 minutes for the AI to begin using the new knowledge in its answers. Be patient after training a large website when testing.

**Q: Can the AI be trained on _all_ the pages on my website?**

A: By default, only the home page of the website will be scraped. The AI can then be trained on up to 100 pages from a website. Choose 'follow links' or 'sitemap' mode for finding pages on a website to give the AI as much content as possible to answer questions for your leads and customers.

**Q: Why am I having issues with AI scraping a certain site?**

A: This may be blocked in the WordPress settings for the site. To check, navigate to the WordPress dashboard > Settings > General > Privacy > Ensure that 'Prevent third-party sharing for' is unchecked.
