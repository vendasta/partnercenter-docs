# Unified SMS Numbers

Businesses often prefer using a single number to communicate with their customers to streamline interactions and ensure consistency. Sending review requests and managing customer responses has become more efficient and integrated.

### **How It Worked Before**

Previously, review requests were sent using a different number than the one used for Inbox communications. This setup required separate A2P registration for each number. Additionally, if a customer replied to a review request via SMS, the response would not be visible in the business's Inbox, leading to potential missed communications and fragmented customer interactions.

### **The Improved Process**

Now, review requests are sent from the same SMS number used for Inbox communications. This integration offers several advantages:

1. **Single A2P Registration:** Businesses only need to register one number for both sending review requests and using Inbox, simplifying the registration process.
2. **Unified Communication:** Review events are logged directly in the Inbox conversation, ensuring that all interactions with a customer are in one place.
3. **Visible Replies:** If a customer replies to a review request, their response will appear in the Inbox, allowing businesses to engage and respond seamlessly.

### **Important Note**

- **Credits and Usage:** There have been no changes to the credits system. Inbox remains unlimited, and Review Management Premium still uses credits as before.

By unifying the SMS number for both review requests and Inbox communications, businesses can enjoy a more streamlined and efficient communication process, ensuring that all customer interactions are easily accessible and manageable from a single platform.
