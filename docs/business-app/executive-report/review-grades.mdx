The Review Grade is a letter grade given to your clients' businesses to evaluate their online review presence. The Review Grade is currently used in our Sales intelligence report, Snapshot Report, to evaluate the business's online reputation before partnering with your company.

The Review Grade in the Executive Report enhances reporting transparency for your clients and shows proof of performance over time.

### How is the Review Grade calculated?

The Review Grade is calculated based on the business' performance in four categories:

- Average review score
- Number of review sources
- Reviews found
- Number of reviews found per month

Scores in the four categories are then combined and compared to the industry average to get the final letter grade using this percentile grading system:

- **A** = 90 - 100th percentile
- **B** = 75 - 89th percentile
- **C** = 50 - 74th percentile
- **D** = 30 - 49th percentile
- **F** = 0 - 29th percentile

*For example, if a business has an average review score of 3.5. This puts the business in the 10th percentile compared to the industry average (4.32) and industry leader (5). This category receives an F. The same calculations are done for the other three categories and a combined score results in a Review Grade of C.*

The Review Grade is turned on by default.
