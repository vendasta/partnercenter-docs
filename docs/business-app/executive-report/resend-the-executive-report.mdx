Ensuring our clients receive a timely Executive Report is essential when building trust, and providing proof of performance. This report will be sent across all of their digital marketing channels week-to-week, or month-to-month, depending on the account activity and your currently selected options.

To manually send an executive report to all users on an account, navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts**, and select the account you would like to resend the report to.

Under the Reports section of the account page, you will see an option called **Resend Executive Report.** This will allow you to select the report to resend. Once you have made your selection from the dropdown menu, simply hit send.
