## Why is the Facebook Ads Performance Summary important?

You and your clients can see what's happening across all your digital marketing channels in one place. This allows you to quickly and easily get insights into which ads are performing well and cut down on overhead with automated reporting.

- Impressions
- Clicks
- Conversions
- Comparisons to a previous time period

## How does the Facebook Ads Performance Summary work?

With Advertising Intelligence activated, connect your Facebook Ads account to the product. Go to the Executive Report in Business App and select a time period. Under the "Advertising" section, there will be a subsection called "Facebook Ads".

Here you are able to view the summary of both your Facebook Ads and Google Ads campaigns. Updated data in the Executive Report is populated every Sunday, starting the week when you connect an account.
