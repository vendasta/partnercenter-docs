# Why is the Executive Report important?

Business App users who receive a weekly or monthly Executive Report email have a **38% higher chance** of being retained compared to those who don't, making automated reporting a necessity for serving your local business clients.

Additionally, Business App users who received an Executive Report with their Google Business Profile insights for at least half of their lifetime saw a **47% increase in retention** after one year compared to those who received a report without Google Business Profile insights. (*Source: Vendasta SMB Retention Survey, 2019*.) With this retention rate, it's important to make sure your clients who have made a connection through Google Business Profile, Facebook, Google Search Console, or Google Analytics receive a notification for their performance in these respective areas.

By receiving proof-of-performance reporting on a consistent basis, you are providing your clients with evidence of the value you bring to their business and engaging them in your Business App offering.
