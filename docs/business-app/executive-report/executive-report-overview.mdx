This article breaks down each section of the Executive Report in an easy-to-understand format. The Executive Report is the client's single source of truth for the state of their online presence. It gives clients a rollup of everything happening across their digital marketing channels week-to-week, or month-to-month. This report is white-labeled, so it's automatically generated under your brand. This automated report gives clients a first-hand look at the return on their investment—it's a great way to build trust, position yourself as an expert, and show how you're delivering results each month.

### **Why is the Executive Report important?**

Give your clients relevant, personalized, actionable data at the right time. The Executive Report is your secret weapon for engaging with your clients, continually proving your value to them, and retaining them for longer. Our study revealed that partners who use the Executive Report and connect a data source like Google Business Profile see a 51% increase in client retention rates over 24 months compared to those who do not use the Executive Report.
By receiving proof-of-performance reporting consistently, you are providing your clients with evidence of the value you bring to their business and engaging them in your Business App offering.

### **When is the Executive Report sent out?**

The Executive Report processes a lot of data. While we do our best to ensure it's ready to go at month's end, you may notice a 2-3 day delay before receiving your monthly report. When the Executive Report is received, it will contain data for the entire month.

The monthly Executive Report usually goes out between the 1st - 3rd days of each month. The weekly Executive Report is sent out on Mondays. The Executive Report may be sent outside of business days as it recognizes the start of each month, not specifically Monday-Friday.

**NOTE -** Accounts with active products generally trigger Executive Reports to be sent, however, for accounts with only Local SEO active, users will not receive any Executive reports if they don't have any changes in data as changes in the data are needed for a new executive report entry.

If there are no changes from the previous month for any specific section of the report, the section will not populate the report for the current month.

### **When is new data updated in the Executive Report?**

New data appears in the Executive Report automatically when supporting products are activated on an account, and some time has passed to allow for the ingestion of data. Times to get data vary based on the product.
We support custom data integrations via API. If you have a database that you'd like to connect to the Executive Report, you can work with your Account Manager for a custom integration via our Marketplace APIs.
