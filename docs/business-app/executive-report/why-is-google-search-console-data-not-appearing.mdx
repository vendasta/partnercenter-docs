# Why is Google Search Console data not appearing in the Executive Report?

## Google Search Console Overview

Google Search Console (GSC) tools and reports are essential for monitoring your site's search traffic and performance, addressing potential issues, and optimizing its visibility in Google Search results.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. **When Was GSC Connected?**  
   Data collection begins after the GSC account is connected, but it can take a few days for the data to populate. Please verify when GSC was connected and check if data is visible within the GSC interface.

2. **Daily Data Collection Timing**:  
   Note that data is collected once daily, typically around midnight CST. Any recent changes may take up to 24 hours to reflect in reports.

3. **When Did the Website Go Live?**  
   If the website is newly launched, there may not be sufficient data yet to display in the reports. Check for activity or traffic within GSC to confirm.

If you have completed these checks and the issue persists, additional investigation may be required.
