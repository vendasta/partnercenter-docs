MarketGoo data populates within the Executive Report under the SEO section. It's important to note that any accounts with MarketGoo Lite will **NOT** populate on the report. MarketGoo submits data on a monthly cadence and as a result, the MarketGoo data is only viewable via the Monthly date range selection.
