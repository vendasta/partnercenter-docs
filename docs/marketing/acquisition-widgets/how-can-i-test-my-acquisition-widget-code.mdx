# How can I test my Acquisition Widget code?

One easy way to determine if a widget is working or not is to copy the widget code and enter it into the HTML portion of [http://codepen.io/pen](http://codepen.io/pen). This will display what the layout looks like to end-users.

If nothing is displayed, the widget may likely be broken. In this instance, please report to Support on Demand via support@vendasta.com.
