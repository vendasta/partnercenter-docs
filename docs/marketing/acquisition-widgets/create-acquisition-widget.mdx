## Configure the Widget

In the Configure step, define the purpose of your widget:

1. Enter a **Name** for your widget.
2. Select an **Account Type**. This will determine which account creation form the customer sees:
   - **Contact**: The contact will be created as a lead and will not have access to Business App. A contact form will be displayed.
   - **Business**: The contact will be created as a lead with a Business Profile. The contact will not have access to Business App, but will be added as a Primary Contact on the Business Profile that is created. If the contact already has a Business Profile, a new Business Profile will not be created. A business form will be displayed.
3. Select a **Partner**.
4. Select which fields to include in your form.
5. Indicate whether or not to make these fields mandatory.
6. Click **Next**.

## Design the Widget

In the Design step, customize how your widget looks:

1. Enter a **Form Title**.
2. Upload a **Logo**.
3. Set the **Theme Color**. This color will be used for the title bar, CTA button, and focus color on your form.
4. Define a **Call to Action** button label.
5. Enter **Form Completion Text**. This text will be displayed once the form has been submitted.
6. Click **Next**.

## Embed the Widget

In the Embed step, get the code needed to place the widget on your website:

1. **Copy the embed code**. This code can be pasted on any web page where you'd like the widget to appear.
2. Choose how the widget should be displayed:
   - **Modal (default)**: Visitors will click on a button (which you can customize) to open the form in a modal window.
   - **Direct**: The form will be embedded directly on your web page.
3. Click **Save** to complete the setup.
