# Send email campaigns

Email campaigns can be initiated at any time to specific contacts, lists, or campaigns.

## Prerequisites

You need:
- A list(s) of contacts to which you want to send the email campaign(s)
- The email campaign designed and ready to send

For more information on creating email campaigns, visit [Email Marketing Templates](/marketing/marketing-campaigns/email-campaigns/email-marketing-templates).

## Send an email campaign

To send an email campaign, you have to include contacts to which you want to send the campaign, and the users or partners who will receive the confirmation emails.

1. From the Marketing Campaigns panel on the left, click **Email Campaigns**.
2. Select the email campaign you wish to send.
3. In the Users step, select which Partners will send the campaign and whether to include the Partner or Campaign list contacts. Partner contacts are the contacts within the Partner. Campaign list contacts are contacts generated from the list(s) selected for the campaign.

## Partner branding on email campaigns

You can brand your email campaigns to match partners' branding by adding the Partner logo and Partner CRM Manager photo to the email. The following will be auto-injected into the email using tokens but can be edited during the design process.

You can choose from the logo tokens:
- **Partner's Logo** – The logo you added to the Partner account.
- **Business's Logo** – The logo that's been added to the Business account.
- **Default Logo** – The generic Snapshot report logo.
