If a user is only assigned to one account and that account is added to a campaign, they will only receive that campaign's emails once. If this account is added to the same campaign again, this user will not receive the emails again.

If a user is assigned to multiple accounts, however, they can receive the campaign emails once for each account they are on. So, they could receive the campaign emails once for "**Account A**" and once for "**Account B**".

- *This is to prevent duplicate emails from going out to the same user for the same account.*
