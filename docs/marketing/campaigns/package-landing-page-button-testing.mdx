## Issue

When I test an email campaign, the button that links to a Package Landing Page does not work.

## Explanation

This may happen because your email is not associated with an account on the campaign. The button will only take a real user, associated with a real account, to the embedded URL. Your customers will be able to click the call to action button and see the corresponding page because their email is associated with a real business account in the selected market. You will not be able to test it under most circumstances, because you are not the customer.

## Solution

To test the Package Landing Page button:

1. [Create an account](/marketing/accounts/create-an-account) for your company.
2. [Add yourself as a user](/marketing/accounts/add-a-user) to your company's account.
   - The campaign will be sent to the email you use to create the user.
3. [Send the campaign](/marketing/marketing-campaigns/send-a-campaign) to your company's account.
