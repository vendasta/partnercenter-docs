Email campaigns are generally sent to users on an account, not contacts, however, this will depend on how you start your campaign. To send a campaign to users on accounts in bulk, navigate to **Partner Center > Marketing > Campaigns > 3 dots next to desired campaign > Add account list to campaign.**
