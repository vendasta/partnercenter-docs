# Add a user list to a campaign

Once you've [created a user list](/marketing/marketing-campaigns/create-a-user-list), you can send an email campaign to the users in that list by adding the list to a campaign.

## Adding a user list to a campaign

To add a user list to a campaign:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Accounts** > **Lists** > **[User lists](https://partners.vendasta.com/action-lists/manage/user-list)**.  
2. Find the list you want to add to the campaign, then click **Add to campaign** at the end of the row.  
3. Select a campaign.
4. Select a start date and time for the campaign (optional).
5. Select who the campaign should be sent from, then click **Next**.
6. Select an account to use for unassociated users (optional). See below for more information.
7. Click **Start campaign**.

### Why select an account for unassociated users?

Each user must have account data to receive a campaign. If you do not select an account, unassociated users in your list *will not* receive the campaign.

### What does this mean?

When you select an account:

- The unassociated users in your list will receive the campaign.
- If your campaign includes any [dynamic components](/marketing/marketing-campaigns/dynamic-components), data from the account will be used to fill in the content for those components.
- The unassociated users will *not* be associated with the account.
- Any users who are already associated with an account will *not* be affected.
