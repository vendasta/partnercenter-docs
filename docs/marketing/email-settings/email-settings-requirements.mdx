# What are the requirements for Email Settings?

Under **Partner Center > Marketing > Email Settings** are DNS settings to help make sure your emails are sent without error from the system.

These records can only be applied to your DNS settings for your email provider if you have a custom domain email.

You will be unable to add these records to an email that is from a free (non-custom) provider (such as emails from gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com, etc.)

If you do not own a custom domain, consider purchasing one through a domain registrar such as GoDaddy. You can use your custom domain to create and maintain a professional email address.
