# Email Authentication

Email authentication is a way to tell receiving mail servers that emails sent from your domain are legitimate. This helps prevent your emails from being marked as spam or rejected. 

To set up email authentication, you need to add specific DNS records to the domain you're using to send emails. This guide will walk you through the process.

## Understanding Email Authentication

Email authentication consists of three main protocols:

1. **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: Specifies which mail servers are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain
2. **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**: Adds a digital signature to your emails that verifies they were sent by an authorized sender
3. **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)**: Tells receiving mail servers what to do with emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks

## Setting up Email Authentication

Follow these steps to set up email authentication for your domain:

### Step 1: Access Email Settings

1. Navigate to **Marketing** > **Email Settings**
2. Select the **Authentication** tab

### Step 3: Verify Domain Ownership

1. After adding your domain, you'll need to verify ownership by adding a TXT record to your domain's DNS settings
2. Copy the provided TXT record value
3. Log in to your domain registrar or DNS provider
4. Add a new TXT record with the host value as specified and paste the value you copied
5. Click **Verify Domain** in Vendasta

### Step 4: Add Authentication Records

Once your domain is verified, you'll need to add the following DNS records:

#### SPF Record

1. Copy the provided SPF record (TXT type)
2. Add it to your domain's DNS settings

### Step 5: Verify Authentication Setup

1. After adding all DNS records, click the **Verify** button for each record
2. Once all records are verified, your domain will show as authenticated

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with email authentication:

- Ensure that you've added all DNS records correctly
- Allow up to 48 hours for DNS changes to propagate
- Check that you've entered the correct hostname for each record
- Verify that your domain registrar supports the required DNS record types

## Benefits of Email Authentication

Properly authenticating your emails provides several benefits:

- Improved deliverability rates
- Reduced chances of emails being marked as spam
- Protection against email spoofing and phishing attempts
- Better sender reputation with email providers

By following these steps, you'll ensure that your marketing emails have the best chance of reaching your customers' inboxes.
