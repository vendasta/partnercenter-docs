# Troubleshooting Emails Sent to Spam - How to Get Email Headers

There are instances when the domain SPF, DMARC, and DKIM records are verified globally but a few emails that go out from the platform still land in the spam folder rather than the inbox.

In cases like this, to troubleshoot further, we may ask for a screenshot of the email received in spam as well as [the email headers](https://mxtoolbox.com/public/content/emailheaders/).

You can refer to these links below to get the email headers about which email services the Partner/client is using. The email headers will help the email team troubleshoot further on the issue.

:::note
**NOTE:** Partners can save the email headers in a notepad/word file and share the same by email to the Support team.
