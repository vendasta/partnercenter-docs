Spam laws and regulations are increasing in complexity, and precautions are needed to prevent emails from being flagged as spam. Update the following settings to ensure your email campaigns pass spam regulations and reach your prospects successfully.

:::note
To prevent emails from being sent on someone's behalf unintentionally, email service providers check the digital records of incoming mail. These records—including Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)—act as digital handshakes agreeing to send an email on someone's behalf. You can prevent your emails from being flagged as spam by updating your Domain Name System (DNS) record with the correct SPF, DKIM, and DMARC entries. Updating these entries creates an agreement between Vendasta and your domain and allows us to send email campaigns on your behalf.

To update email campaign settings:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Marketing** > **[Email Settings](https://partners.vendasta.com/campaign-settings)**.  
2. Enter the correct Email 'Send As' Information for your campaigns. 
   :::note
   **Note:** When a salesperson is assigned to an account, the salesperson's email address and name will be used instead of these settings.
   :::
3. Verify the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC Validations under your domain. A green circle with a checkmark means that the record is validated correctly; a red circle with an exclamation mark means that the record is invalid.
4. For each invalid record, update your DNS record with the correct entries. For assistance, you can contact Support on Demand at support@vendasta.com or your DNS service provider.

### **Important Notes**

Setting Vendasta as a trusted service provider does not guarantee that emails will not be flagged as spam. To ensure your emails are delivered successfully, check the content and subject lines of your emails. Make sure to avoid:

- Colored text
- Text in all caps
- Attachments
- Exclamation marks
- Promotional words and phrases (such as "make money," "save money," "cheap," and "act now")
- Profanity and explicit content

These may cause your emails to be flagged as spam.

If you do not own a custom domain, consider purchasing one through a domain registrar such as GoDaddy. You can use your custom domain to create and maintain a professional email address.
