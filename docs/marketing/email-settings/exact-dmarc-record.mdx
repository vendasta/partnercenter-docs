# Should I Add the Exact DMARC Record Provided by the Platform?

**Short Answer:**  
No, the DMARC record provided by the platform is a recommendation, not a requirement.

**Explanation:**  
The DMARC record you see on the platform is a suggested configuration. However, you are not limited to using this exact record. Any valid DMARC record will work, even if it's provided by another service.

The key requirement is that the DMARC record you add must be valid for the verification process to succeed.
