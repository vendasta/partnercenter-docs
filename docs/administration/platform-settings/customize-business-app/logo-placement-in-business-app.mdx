# Logo Placement in Business App

The Partner logo can be seen in the bottom left of Business App, near the salesperson's contact info.

If you'd like to move your logo to the top instead, go to **Partner Center > Administration > Customize Business App > Branding > Turn off 'Display your logo in footer of Business App navigation.'**

**Note:** if you turn off the appearance setting as shown below, the logo will be moved to the top left corner of the business app.
