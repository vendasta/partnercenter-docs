# Customize Business App

The Business App is designed to be simple and intuitive for your clients to use. However, you can further customize it to tailor the experience for your customers.

## Types of Business App Customizations

The following are ways to customize your customer's Business App experience:

### Show/Hide Dashboard Pages

You have the ability to show or hide different pages in your clients' Business Apps. This option is available in your Partner Center under **Administration > Platform Settings > Business App Settings**. Here, you can select which pages are visible to each customer (Grow, Listings, Protect, Connect, Reputation, etc.).

### Add/Remove Dashboard Cards

You can also customize what cards appear on your clients' dashboards. The Business App dashboard is designed to highlight products that you offer. The dashboard cards are meant to surface insights for your customers at a glance, as well as provide a snapshot of the state of their digital presence. 

Example Dashboard cards include:

#### Review Grade

### Change the Look and Feel

Beyond showing/hiding pages and cards, you also have options to enhance and customize the overall look and feel of the Business App under **Administration > Platform Settings > Customize Partner Center & Business App**. From here, you can customize both your Partner Center and your Business App.

### New Customer Experience

Past versions of the Business App displayed a card to show customers the number of days left in free trial. The New Customer Experience replaces this with a more dynamic, flexible view of the client's journey. It displays progress in an action-oriented way, customized to show clients what they need to do next.

You can add your customers to this journey in the Business App by going to **Administration > Clients > Add your clients**. New clients will automatically be added to this experience.

## Best Practices for Business App Customization

When customizing the Business App for your clients, consider these best practices:

1. **Focus on client needs**: Only show pages and cards that are relevant to the services you're providing to each client
2. **Keep it simple**: Don't overwhelm clients with too many options or too much information
3. **Align with your branding**: Use consistent colors, logos, and messaging that match your company's branding
4. **Test the experience**: View the Business App as your clients would see it to ensure it provides a clear, intuitive experience
5. **Gather feedback**: Ask clients for feedback on their experience with the Business App and make adjustments accordingly
