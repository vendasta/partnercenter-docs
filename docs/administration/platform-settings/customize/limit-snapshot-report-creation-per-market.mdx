Unfortunately, there is no direct way of limiting snapshots report creation per Market. However, you can limit snapshots creation per salesperson(s) within a specific market.

Here is how:

Step 1: In **Partner Center**, navigate to the **Administration** tab > **Customize** > **Sales**

Step 2: Under the Sales tab, click the '**limit monthly snapshot report**' checkbox.

Step 3: An additional option will be displayed to set the '**snapshot creation limit**' for the salespeople in the market.

**Note:** If multiple salespeople are working in a particular market, which is oftentimes the case, the market limit will be the total allowable maximum that all the Salespeople in that market can create combined.
