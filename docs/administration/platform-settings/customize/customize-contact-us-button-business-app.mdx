# Customize the Contact Us button in Business App

The **Contact Us** button is displayed to your customers at the bottom right of their screen when they are logged into Business App. When your customer clicks on this button, they are presented with options for contacting support.

The default options are the **Help Center** and **Email**. Clicking **Help Center** will open your support site, while clicking **Email** will open your customers' default email client with your support email address filled in.

As an Administrator, you can customize the **Contact Us** button, changing the default text, adding a phone number, and removing certain options. You can also customize the support email address that's used with the email option.

## How to customize the Contact Us button

1. Log in to [Partner Center](https://app.vendasta.com)
2. Click the **More** button at the bottom of the navigation menu on the left side of the screen

4. Under **Business App Customization**, select the options you want to include in the **Contact Us** button:
   - **Help Center** - Enable/disable the link to your support site
   - **Email** - Enable/disable the email option
   - **Phone** - Enable/disable the phone number option

5. If you enable the **Phone** option, enter the phone number you want to display to your customers

6. If you enable the **Email** option, you can customize the support email address

7. You can also customize the text that's displayed on the **Contact Us** button

8. When you're done, click **Save** at the bottom of the page

## What your customers will see

After you've customized the **Contact Us** button, your customers will see the options you've enabled when they click on the button in Business App. If you've customized the text on the button, they'll see your custom text instead of "Contact Us".

If you've enabled the phone option, your customers will see a phone number they can call for support. The phone number is displayed as text - clicking on it does not initiate a call.

## Considerations

- Changes to the **Contact Us** button apply to all your customers
- You need Administrator permissions to customize the **Contact Us** button
- The **Contact Us** button appears on all pages in Business App
