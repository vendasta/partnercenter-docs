# How do I restore my market's sales order settings to my defaults?

If you've configured your sales order settings for a market, you can restore these to your partner defaults. To do this: 

1. Go to **Partner Center > Administration > Customize**
2. Click **Markets**
3. Click the edit icon ![edit icon](/img/restore-market-settings/edit-icon.png) next to the market you wish to restore
4. Go to **Sales > Configure Orders and Sales Processes**
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Restore Back to Partner Defaults.**

**Note:** **Restore Back to Partner Defaults** will only appear if you've previously configured the market's sales order settings.
