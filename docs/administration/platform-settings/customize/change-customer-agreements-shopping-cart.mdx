Partners who would like to surface their own Terms of Service to customers at the time of purchase can do so on the **Order Confirmation** page of the Shopping Cart.

Go to **Partner Center > Administration > Customize > Sales**, and click [Configure orders and sales processes](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-design/customize-sales-orders/) under the **Sales Processes** section. Under the **Customer Terms of Service Configuration** setting, you will have the option to attach your own Terms of Service document, which will be accessible for users on the **Order Confirmation** page for both purchases and sales orders made using the Shopping Cart.

Additionally, clicking **+ Add Terms of Service** will allow for more customization and formatting of your Terms of Service messaging, including explanatory text and the title of the link that will lead to your Terms of Service document. Partners also have the option to require their customers to click a checkbox to signify that they agree to the Terms of Service before completing their purchase or order.
