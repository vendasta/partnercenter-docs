# Customize Listing and Review Sources

The Listing Management app provides the ability to select which listing and review sites are enabled for each of your customers. This allows you to select which sites are most relevant based on their industry and location.

## Accessing the Listing and Review Sources Settings

To access the Listing and Review Sources menu:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Platform Settings > Customize**
2. Under **Product Settings**, locate and select **Listing and Review Sources**

## Managing Listing and Review Sites

The Listing Management interface is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Filters Section

![Listings interface filters](/img/listing-review-sources/listings-interface-1.jpg)

This section allows you to filter sites by:

- **Countries**: Select one or multiple countries (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, etc.)
- **Categories**: Filter by business category (restaurants, hotels, retail, etc.)
- **Sources**: Filter by type of source (listing sites, review sites, or both)

### 2. Sources Section

![Listings sources display](/img/listing-review-sources/listings-interface-2.jpg)

This section displays all available sources based on your filter selections. For each source, you can:

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle whether the source is enabled for your customers
- **Default/Optional**: Determine if the source is enabled by default or optional

## Setting Default Sources

You can configure which sources are enabled by default for new customers by setting them as either:

- **Default**: These sources will be automatically selected when setting up new customers
- **Optional**: These sources will be available but not automatically selected

To change a source from Default to Optional (or vice versa):

1. Locate the source in the list
2. Click the dropdown menu next to the source name
3. Select either "Default" or "Optional"

## Sources by Country and Industry

The available listing and review sites vary by country. Vendasta continually updates the available sources to ensure the most relevant sites are included for each market.

## Notes

- Changes to the default sources will only affect new customer accounts, not existing ones
- You can adjust sources for individual customers through their account settings
- Some specialized industry sources may only appear when specific categories are selected
