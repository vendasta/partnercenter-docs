Vendasta is a white-label platform—meaning you can brand it as your own, with no mention of Vendasta. White labeling allows you to present a unified front with the solutions you already offer to your customers.

Your branding is used in all customer-facing aspects of the platform, including Business App, email campaigns and more.

- To customize your branding – including Name and Logos go to **Partner Center** > **Administration** > **[Partner branding](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-branding)**.
- To customize the name of Business App, go to **Partner Center** > **Accounts** > **Manage Business App** > **[Customize Business App](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-business-app/overview)**

Please note: Some white-labelling aspects of the platform may be limited by [subscription.](https://www.vendasta.com/pricing/)

### Customizable brand elements

You can customize the following features under the **Partner Branding** tab:

   [Company Name](#2-company-name)

   [Theme](#3-theme)

   [Logo](#5-logo)

   [Favicon](#6-favicon)

   [Shortcut icon](#7-company-avatar---shortcut-icon)

   [Primary Color](#8-primary-color)


### Company Name

The company name to display to your customers on the platform, emails, etc. This is a required field.

### Theme

Select your preferred theme (light or dark) for your team to experience in Partner Center. This will apply to the navigation only.

### Business App Theme

Choose a default theme for your customers to experience Business App in, light or dark. We recommend User System Default, which matches the users' system settings. Users can also override your default choice when using the app to suit their needs.

### Logo

Your logo appears in various places throughout the platform whenever white labeling is used. Your logo also appears in emails sent through the platform.

It's important to ensure your logo looks good in both light and dark mode, and you can upload unique logos for each.

### Favicon

A favicon is a small graphic that appears in the browser tab for Business App, helpful for differentiating your business app from other tabs the user might have open.

The recommended file size is 16px (width) by 16px (height). Only ICO files are accepted.

### Company avatar / Shortcut icon

A shortcut icon is an icon that appears on mobile phones and devices when saved to the user's home screen. It is also used to represent your company internally in Inbox chat.

The recommended file size is 512 x 512 pixels. Only GIF, JPG, and PNG files are accepted.

### Primary Color

The platform displays your brand color in various accent places throughout the platform to represent your brand. This color also appears in some emails sent to clients.


### Custom branding for markets

By default, any options set under **Partner Branding** apply to your markets as well. If you've customized a market separately (under the **Markets** tab), any changes made under **Partner Branding** may *not* apply to those markets.

To customize by Market, click the 'All Market' tab and select the market you want to customize.

### Web Chat

![Web Chat](/img/administration/partner-branding/web-chat.jpg)

You have the ability to enable a backlink footer on all your client web chat widgets, that says "Chat powered by [Your Company Name]" with a link to your website, to add some SEO-juice and drive new leads. The link has an automatically appended UTM so you can track engagement via Google Analytics.

To enable, go to **Partner Center** > **Manage Accounts** > **Manage Business App** > **Customize Business App** > **[Branding](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-business-app/branding)** and then enable the checkbox titled: "Show 'Chat powered by [Your Company Name]' on all web chat widgets"
