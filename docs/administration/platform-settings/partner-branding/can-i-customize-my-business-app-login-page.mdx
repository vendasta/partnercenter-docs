# Can I customize my Business App Login Page?

You cannot white-label the Business App login page, however, if you are using multiple markets with different branding on each, you can use a generic logo for the default branding market. This will display the generic logo on the login page, and as soon as the user logs into Business App the market-specific branding will be shown within Business App.

To change the branding, please go to **Administration** > **Partner Branding** > **Logo**.

If you have multiple markets and would like to brand them differently, select another Market in the '**All Markets**' tab (top right of the same page) and customize accordingly.
