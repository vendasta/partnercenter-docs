# Can products get automatically activated?

**Yes.** Checking the following areas on the platform will provide a better understanding of what may have occurred.

1. Check if there is any active automation that may auto-activate products in **Partner Center > Automations > My automations.**

2. Check the product settings under **Marketplace > Products** to see if automatic activation is turned on or off.

3. Check the **Acquisition Widget** under the Marketing tab to see if product activation is enabled.

4. For Orders created, the Order details will show if it was a 'manual automation' or not under Tags.
   - When it shows 'product manual automation' it means the products were manually activated.
   - The Activation History on the account will display the email address of who activated the product.

Verifying all these 4 steps will provide a full picture and help you address the Partner's concerns better.
