# Customize your domains

:::note
Custom domains are available for most paid subscriptions. Please refer to [vendasta.com/pricing](https://www.vendasta.com/pricing/) for more details on eligibility as per the subscription tiers.

When we set up your white label, we ask about your preferences for which URLs your customers, prospects, and salespeople see. There are two options: Default URLs and Custom URLs. Our Partners typically choose to customize their domains if they already have a website and access to its DNS settings. Partner's who wish to maintain white-label for Sales teams in the Partner Center CRM will also need to customize their domains.

**To customize your domains:**

- Fill in [this form](https://custom-domains-form.websitepro.hosting/) to send us your domain preferences.

Once you submit the form, we'll email you TXT and CNAME records, along with instructions on how to enter them into your DNS settings.
