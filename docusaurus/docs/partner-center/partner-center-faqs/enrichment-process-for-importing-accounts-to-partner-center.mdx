Google's inference is used during the bulk account import process and requires the **Company Name, Zipcode, and Google Place ID** to work.

### **What Information Do We Infer?**

- companyName
- website
- workNumber
- latitude
- longitude
- address
- city
- state
- zip
- country
- taxonomyId
- hoursOfOperation
- socialUrls

Our system will attempt to pull additional data provided **the box at the bottom of the upload wizard called 'Attempt to fill in empty cells' is checked.**

If there is any doubt about identifying the correct business (via Google search), we will not import any data to avoid pulling in the wrong data. 

Note: The enrichment only takes place when the account is created, not when the account is updated and requires:

- **Company Name, Zipcode, and Google Place ID**
- The **'Attempt to fill in empty cells'** box must be checked
