# Why are the products' URLs not secure?

Our team uses Google-managed SSL certificates and these are applied to the login portals - Business App, and Partner Center.

Outside of that, we do not currently auto-uplift those certificates in the individual apps such as Reputation Management and Local SEO as they would be behind those login portals.

On a case-by-case basis, the Technical Team can assist with securing the URL to uplift to HTTPS using Postman. Please reach out to Support on Demand ([support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com)).
