# Scoring in the CRM

Lead Scoring in the CRM is designed to empower customer-facing representatives with more precise and customizable lead prioritization tools. This new feature allows CRM users to create different scores as a contact or company field based on buyer profile fit and buyer intention. By incorporating these two critical dimensions, representatives can efficiently prioritize their outreach, significantly improving their chances of closing deals and maximizing their selling time.

## How to use Scoring

**Step 1:** Navigate to **Partner Center > Administration > Score.**

**Step 2:** Configure the positive/negative scoring criteria and hit save.

**Step 3:** The score will populate on the company table right away.

**Step 4:** Continue to look for other businesses, or click **View companies** to go to the company table and start working on the businesses that you just created.
