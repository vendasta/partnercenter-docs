**Mark as complete:** This action will mark the task as completed. You have the option to reopen the task afterward before you jump to the next task.

**Reschedule:** This action allows you to reschedule the due date of the task. You will be moved to the next task after rescheduling.

**Skip:** This action will push the task to the bottom of the queue. So you can come back to them at the very last.

**Navigate to other records associated with the tasks:** The association dropdown allows you to jump between different records associated with the task to help you complete your task.

**Exit the task queue:** Clicking on the cross button will allow you to exit the task queue. You can enter a new session of the task queue through the sales tasks table.
