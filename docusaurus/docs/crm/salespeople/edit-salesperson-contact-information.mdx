# Edit Salesperson contact information

The CRM allows you to connect your salespeople with their Snapshot Report sidebar, Snapshot Report printout, Business App, and campaign emails by adding in their personal contact information.

## Snapshot Report Sidebar

When contact information is set for a salesperson, their details will automatically appear in the sidebar of any Snapshot Report created or updated by them.

## Snapshot Report Printout

Contact information will also appear on the Snapshot Report printout.

## Business App

A salesperson's contact information will appear in the Business App when a client is looking at the "Your Rep" section.

## Campaign Emails

You can also set up a default sender for campaigns - this would be your company's information, with your logo, etc. Alternatively, you can choose to have campaign emails come from each salesperson. To do this, we pull in the salesperson's contact information.
