My Meetings is a free addition to Business App. Users can set up booking links, sync meetings with Google Calendar set their availability, and more.

It allows their clients to find times that work for both parties!

### **Why does it matter?**

Booking meetings can be tedious. First, you have to find a time that works well for all parties, then communicate back and forth to make sure nothing goes awry. There's software that helps with this, but many are expensive and don't tie into the software already in use.

And that doesn't even cover the overhead of sending out reminders and tracking existing appointments to make sure they aren't missed.
