# Team booking links

Team booking links allow you to create a single booking link that will distribute meetings to a team of users. For example, your business might do a qualification call before handing a prospect over to a sales rep. You can create a team booking link for your qualification team and let My Meetings randomly distribute meetings to team members. This page explains how to set up and manage team booking links.

## Creating team booking links

You will need admin permissions to setup team booking links.

First, you will need to create a Sales Team in Partner Center. To do this, navigate to CRM > Sales Teams in the left-hand menu and click Create Team.

To create a Team booking link:

1. Log in to the Partner Center
2. Navigate to **My Meetings**
3. Click on **Admin** (**Note**: this option is only available to users assigned the admin role for the My Meetings section)
4. Click on **TEAM BOOKING LINKS**

## Create a new team booking link

1. Click on **+ New Team booking** to start the process

2. Configure the following fields in the form:

![Team booking form](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-3.png)

- **Event Title**: This is what clients will see when they book a meeting
- **Event Link Name**: This creates the URL for your booking link (e.g., /team-meeting)
- **Description**: Optional information about the meeting
- **Duration**: Length of the meeting
- **Team Members**: Select team members to include in this booking link

3. Click **SAVE** to create the team booking link

## Assignment methods

When creating a team booking link, you can choose how meetings will be distributed to team members.

![Assignment methods](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-4.png)

There are three options:

1. **Random**: Meetings are randomly assigned to available team members
2. **Round-robin**: Meetings are assigned in a specific order to available team members
3. **Custom**: Set a weighted distribution to give some team members more meetings than others

### Custom weighted distribution

When selecting the Custom assignment method, you can set a weight for each team member which determines how many meetings they receive compared to others.

![Custom weighted distribution](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-5.png)

For example, if you set:
- Team Member 1: Weight 1
- Team Member 2: Weight 2
- Team Member 3: Weight 3

Team Member 3 will get 3x more meetings than Team Member 1 and 1.5x more than Team Member 2.

## Managing availability

You can set specific days and times when team members are available for bookings.

![Managing availability](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-6.png)

Team members can be assigned to different days and time periods. For example, some team members might be available Monday-Wednesday while others are available Thursday-Friday.

## Timezone settings

You can choose how timezone settings are handled for team bookings.

![Timezone settings](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-7.png)

Options include:
- Using the company timezone
- Adjusting to the visitor's timezone
- Setting a specific timezone

## Customizing your booking page

Personalize the team booking page with custom colors and booking questions.

![Customizing booking page](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-8.png)

You can add custom questions that visitors must complete when booking a meeting. This information will be available to the team member who receives the booking.

## Viewing and sharing your team booking link

After creating a team booking link, you can view and share it with prospects and clients.

![Sharing team booking link](/img/crm/my-meetings/team-booking-links-9.png)

1. Click the **VIEW** button to see how your booking page appears to visitors
2. Use the **COPY LINK** button to copy the booking URL to your clipboard
3. Share the link via email, social media, or add it to your website

## Monitoring performance

Admins can monitor the performance of team booking links by viewing the dashboard, which shows metrics such as:

- Number of meetings booked
- Distribution of meetings among team members
- Booking conversion rates
- Popular booking times

Use this data to optimize your team's availability and improve the booking experience for your customers.
