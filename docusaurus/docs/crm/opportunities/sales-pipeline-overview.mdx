The Sales Pipeline is a vital tool for guiding leads from prospects to paying customers, providing both Salespeople and Sales Managers with a clear view of each opportunity's status. By understanding what stage their opportunities are in, Salespeople can take the necessary steps to close deals, while Managers can track potential revenue and support their teams in driving more sales. The pipeline's ability to organize, filter, and visualize opportunities makes it an indispensable resource, ensuring that time and efforts are focused where they can yield the highest return.

## Table View

The table view is a great way to get a full list of either your own, or a teams sales opportunities.

- To access the table view, login to Partner Center and navigate to **CRM > Opportunities > Table.**
- In this view, you have a range of options on how you'd like to filter or organize the list of opportunities.
- You will find a search box above the pipeline, allowing you to search for specific types of opportunities.
  - **Note:** Currently, you can only search for opportunity types, ex: Website Creation, Visibility & SEO. You won't be able to search for any other categories at this time.

## Sort Options

- You can sort the pipeline table columns in either descending or ascending order. Click the name of the column you'd like to sort once for descending order, or twice for ascending order.
- You can also sort the pipeline using the drop-down menu in the top right. This allows you to sort by expected closed date and contract length to get an idea of your monthly revenue. As an example: If a 6-month opportunity is expected to close on May 1st, you would see that reflected in your potential revenue for May-October.
