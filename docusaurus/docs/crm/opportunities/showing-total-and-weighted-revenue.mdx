## What Does This Mean for You?

With this feature, you can:

- **Track Performance:** Easily demonstrate the total and expected revenue generated for your local business clients.
- **Improve Forecasting:** Understand the potential value of deals in progress and make informed decisions to drive sales.
- **Enhance Transparency:** Showcase proof of performance by quantifying your CRM's impact on revenue generation.

By incorporating total and weighted revenue metrics into your pipeline stages, you'll have a more accurate representation of your sales performance and potential outcomes.

**Flexibility to Create Opportunities in the Right Pipeline Stage**

We understand that not every contact starts at the same point in their customer journey. Some leads might already be further along when they enter your CRMâ€”for example, if a contact has already booked an appointment. To address this, Vendasta's CRM allows you to create opportunities directly in the most appropriate stage of the pipeline.
