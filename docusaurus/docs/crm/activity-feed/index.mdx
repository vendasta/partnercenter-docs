# Activity Feed

The Activity Feed in the Partner Center CRM is a centralized feed that provides real-time updates on all sales activities, so that your team can stay informed about what's happening with prospects in the organization.

Use the Activity Feed as a single place to stay in the loop for all sales activities across your organization. It's also a quick way for sales managers to see activities at a glance so they can coach their team on calls or meetings.
