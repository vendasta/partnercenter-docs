# SaaS Metrics dashboard

You can find the SaaS Metrics dashboard by going to **Partner Center > Metrics**. The SaaS Metrics dashboard displays the metrics that matter most for your business. Each day, you can use these metrics to track engagement across your sales team and clients, identify popular products and services, monitor revenue growth, and more. Each top-level metric card also leads to a more detailed breakdown of the data that informs it.

## What is Gross Marketplace Revenue?

The estimated gross revenue that you have brought in via the products in your Marketplace.

**How to use Gross Marketplace Revenue**

This metric indicates comparative progress month-over-month. Use this metric to track growth in your revenue as you introduce new products and services to your Marketplace.

**How to move this metric**

Gross Marketplace Revenue = Product Retail Price * # of Products Sold

Driving all of the other key metrics provided in your SaaS Metrics Dashboard will help influence your overall revenue.

Note: The revenue reflected in this chart is derived from the set Retail Price of your Marketplace products. By default, the Retail Price is set by the vendor (MSRP). If you are selling a product at a different price, make sure to [manually set your Retail Price](/reports/metrics/saas-metrics-dashboard) so that this chart will display more accurate data.

## Average Revenue per Paying Account (ARPPA)

**What is (ARPPA)?**

The estimated monthly revenue brought in per paying account.

**How to use (ARPPA)**

ARPPA is valuable for comparing groups or cohorts of accounts per month. Use this metric to understand how much each account contributes on average to your total revenue. This metric can also be used to spot trends in account expansion or contraction, evaluate your pricing plans, and understand how your revenue is evolving over time.

**How to move this metric**

ARPPA = (Product Retail Price * # of Products Sold) / # Of Accounts With A Paid Product

Increasing your clients' basket size can help drive their revenue as well. In addition, selling your clients higher-priced products, like an SEO solution, can influence this metric.

Note: The revenue reflected in this chart is derived from the set Retail Price of your Marketplace products. By default, the Retail Price is set by the vendor (MSRP). If you are selling a product at a different price, make sure to [manually set your Retail Price](/reports/metrics/saas-metrics-dashboard) so that this chart will display more accurate data.

## Average Basket Size

**What is Average Basket Size?**

This metric indicates the average number of paid products active on accounts with at least one paying account.

**How to use Average Basket Size**

The higher the basket size, the more solutions your customers are purchasing. A high basket size indicates that you are generating revenue expansion from your existing clients through add-ons, upsells, or cross-sells.

Note that this metric only tracks active paid products. An account with one paid product and three free products will have a basket size of one.

We recommend aiming for an average basket size of around four products per paying account. Our [recent research](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/vendasta-client-churn-study) shows that selling a client one product has a retention rate of only 30% after two years. Selling that client just one more product showed an increased retention rate of nearly 20% while selling a client four products showed a retention rate of 80%.

**How to move this metric**

Average Basket Size = # of Paid Products / # of Paying Accounts

Sell your clients complementary products in a package to help increase their basket size. Products like G Suite, Website Pro, and GoDaddy would be great suites to offer your clients.

## Active Salespeople

**What are Active Salespeople?**

The rolling 30-day number of unique salesperson users who have interacted with the platform engaged with emails in the platform, or have performed sales activities (contacting a prospect, submitting an order, etc.). Each data point in the chart shows the total number of unique salesperson users that have been active in the platform in the 30 days preceding each date across the date range that you select.

**How to use Active Salespeople**

Use the Engaged Salespeople chart to see how many of your salespeople are taking to expand your clientele and affect the other metrics on the dashboard.

**How to move this metric**

Active Salespeople = For each day: Distinct # of Salespeople Performing a Tracked Activity Over Last 30 Days

By assigning more accounts to your salespeople, they will receive email notifications and hot leads when an account does certain actions. These notifications will help engage your salespeople and drive them into the CRM.

## Engaged Accounts

**What are Engaged Accounts?**

The number of accounts that are interacting with your email campaigns, product offerings, or your Business Center. Each data point in the chart shows the total number of unique accounts that have been active in the platform in the 30 days preceding each date across the date range that you select.

**How to use Engaged Accounts**

Dig into this metric to see which of your email campaigns is generating interest, which products your customers are interested in, and which accounts are ready to convert.

**How to move this metric**

Engaged Accounts = For each day: Distinct # of Accounts Performing a Tracked Activity Over the Last 30 Days

See which products your customers are interested in, and create a cross-sell or upsell path for them. Analyze emails with high engagement and which part of it drives engagement. Is it the product, the subject, or the call to action? Keep a list of best practices.

## Account Retention Rate

**What is Account Retention Rate?**

This indicates how many accounts have retained their paid products.

**How to use Account Retention Rate**

A high value for this metric indicates that your customers are satisfied and are finding value in your products. This metric is one of the most important indicators of customer satisfaction.

A retention rate of 100% indicates that all of your accounts have kept at least one paid product. When an account cancels or does not renew its paid products, the rate will drop, even if that customer is replaced by a new one. As such, this metric indicates retention, not expansion.

Note that this metric only tracks paying accounts. If an account has canceled its paid products but still has active free products, it will still be recorded as having churned.

**How to move this metric**

Account Retention Rate = For each month: % of Existing Accounts Keeping one or More Paid Recurring Products (New Accounts this Month Excluded)

From our [recent research](https://www.vendasta.com/blog/vendasta-client-churn-study), we have identified a few actions that can help retain your clientsâ€”encouraging engagement, getting them to authenticate GMB, and sending proof of performance reports, to name a few.
