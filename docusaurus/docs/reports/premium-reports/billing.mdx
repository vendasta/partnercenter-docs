A dashboard is often constructed from a set of different data sources. There are data freshness labels at the bottom of each dashboard that indicate the following two things:

1. The refresh interval (text in bold and on top). This reflects how often the data source with the lowest refresh frequency gets updated.
2. The last refresh timestamp (text at the bottom). This reflects the earliest time when a data source was last updated in the dashboard.
