# Configure Standard Products Upgrade Paths to Custom Packages

We've made it possible for Partners to configure their own upgrade path from a Standard product to virtually any product or package they want. This enables Partners to sell their own products and services to their most engaged customers.

## How does it work?

## Partner Workflow

Below are the steps you would follow when selecting a custom package to be the upgrade option. These steps use Reputation Management Standard as an example.

Before configuring the upgrade workflow, you must have a package created and published to your Store. Follow [these steps](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-general/create-manage-custom-packages) to add products to a package and publish them to your Store.

Best practices to follow in creating your custom package:

- Include the Pro edition of the product in the package (i.e. Reputation Management Pro)
- Include complementary products from the [Marketplace](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products)
- Include custom products/fulfillment services you've created

1. With a package created and added to your Store, go to **Marketplace** > **Products** > **Reputation Management**
2. **If you have Markets:** select the **Market** dropdown menu > select the Market that you want this custom upgrade path to be available for
3. Click the tab **Product info**
4. Under **Upgrade Path**, select the option **Upgrade to a custom package**
5. Search for your custom package in the field '**Choose package**' and select the package you created. (*Note: Partners can select up to 30 custom packages*)
6. If more than one package is selected, Partner can choose which price they would like to display from the **Display price** dropdown menu (Note: you may also check the box **Hide price** to hide the price from the modal)
7. Click **Custom modal content** to customize the Title, Content, and Call-to-action button > and upload a custom image that will appear in the upgrade modal > **Save**

## Client Workflow

Below are the steps your SMB client would follow when choosing to upgrade their Standard product. These steps use Reputation Management Standard as an example.

1. From **Business App** > **Reputation Management Standard**
2. Click **Get Pro** in the top left or click on any of the Pro tabs in the product (indicated by the Pro badge)
3. *If one custom package is available:* Click **Upgrade to Pro** to be taken to the order form > complete the order form > Click **Agree to purchase**

OR: *If more than one custom package is available:* Click **Upgrade to Pro** to be taken to the Store, filtered to show the available upgrades for the product > Select desired product > **Get it now** > Complete the order form > Click **Agree to purchase.**
