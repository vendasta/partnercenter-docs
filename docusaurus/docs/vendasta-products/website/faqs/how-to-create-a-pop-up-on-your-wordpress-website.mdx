# How to create a Pop-Up on your WordPress Website

Popups allow you to grow your mailing list, build relationships with your audience via email, and speed up the buyer's journey. Though the primary purpose of pop-ups is **to generate leads**, you can promote your e-book, guide, or case study relevant to the page the visitor is on.

**Step 1:** Log in to **WordPress** Dashboard and install the plugin called DIVI popup.

**Step 2:** After installing and activating the plugin, enable the Visual Builder by visiting the website. (Make sure you are logged in to WordPress Dashboard to enable the option).

**Step 3:** To create a pop-up, we would need to first create a button, so when the user clicks on that button the pop-up will show up.

**Step 4:** Add a section and select the '**Button**' option from the module.

**Step 5:** After creating a button, you would need to add a Button link.

  * Always add the button link as # plus button name (e.g. #Hello).

**Step 6:** Now add a new section by selecting either Text, Image, etc. (whatever you would like to display when the button is clicked).

**Step 7:** Select that section and enable the option **This is a POPUP.** And enter the POPUP ID. Click on save (Ctrl + S)

Popup is enabled when you click on the button.

**Please note:** Make sure you use the lowercase alphabet when adding the pop-up ID.
