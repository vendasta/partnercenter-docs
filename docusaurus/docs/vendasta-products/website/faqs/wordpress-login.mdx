To access your WordPress dashboard, clients must log in via Business App. (Partner Center admins are able to launch Website Pro from the client's account page without logging in to Business App first.)

**To log in to WordPress via Business App:**

Log in to **Business App > My Products >** Click on **Website Pro >** Launch the **WordPress Dashboard.**
