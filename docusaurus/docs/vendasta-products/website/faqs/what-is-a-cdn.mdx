### **What is a CDN and why should I use one?**

A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of servers designed to better serve websites and content globally. When a user attempts to load a page, CDNs will deliver content from the server that is closest to the user. This reduces latency and allows sites to load faster, resulting in a better user experience.

Here is an article with a practical explanation - [https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/what-cloud-cdn-and-how-does-it-work](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/what-cloud-cdn-and-how-does-it-work)

### **Can I turn off the CDN?**
