This notification on WordPress Site Health is normal. It means that the auto-updates of WordPress are set to be blocked.

It's a bit risky to auto-update WordPress because if your plugins and themes are not up to date, the site will be broken immediately after the update. Also if the plugin vendor or theme vendor doesn't have an update ready, the site will be broken until an update is available.
