Yes, SEO-related bot crawling is restricted on temporary URLs.

**Explanation:**  
Website Pro restricts SEO bots from crawling temporary URLs. This limitation helps prevent issues such as a drop in domain reputation or potential blacklistings.

For optimal SEO performance, we recommend connecting a domain to your site before beginning any SEO efforts. A mapped domain is required for bots to properly crawl and index the site.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
