**No. We can only import WordPress sites on Website Pro.** Wix is a Website builder and Wordpress is a CMS. Templates offered in WIX are unique and limited only to Website Builder. It would not be available in the Wordpress Theme Repository. 

## A CMS Offers More Flexibility

- You can easily add pages and posts
- Install Plugins [like the free and easy-to-use Page Builders (Elementor)](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-plugins).
- Customize the design of your site with hundreds of free and premium themes, and much more.
