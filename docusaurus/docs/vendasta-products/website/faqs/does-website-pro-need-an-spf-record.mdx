No, the only records needed are the 2 DNS Records, the A Record, and CNAME that is pointing to Website Pro.

**A Record**  
Name: @ or domain name  
Value: 34.149.86.124  
TTL: leave as default

**CNAME Record**  
Name: www  
Value: host.websiteprohosting.com  
TTL: leave as default

Please note these changes might cause downtime on the live website for a few hours for the records to propagate and come back live with the website hosted at our end.
