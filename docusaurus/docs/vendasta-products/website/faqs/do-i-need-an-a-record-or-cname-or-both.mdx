To link a domain to Website Pro you must use at least one of either an **A record** or **a CNAME record**. Which one you use depends on whether you want to link the root domain or a subdomain to Website Pro. 

To link the root naked domain you would use an A record. 

To link a subdomain(www) you would use a CNAME record.
