Website Pro provides DDOS protection by leveraging [Google Cloud's infrastructure security](https://cloud.google.com/security). In addition, we provide IP-based rate limiting on all requests. Also, given that the majority of all WordPress attacks are targeted at the wp-login.php page, Website Pro gives you the option for Single Sign-On access to the *wp-login.php* page. This means that only users who log into our secure dashboard first will be granted access to the WordPress admin of your site.
