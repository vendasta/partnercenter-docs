You can [create your own custom website templates](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-website/vendasta-products-website-faqs/create-custom-templates) for Website Standard or Pro from scratch, or you can also import your own template by importing it as a site and saving it as a template.

To import a site as a template, follow these steps:

## In your existing WordPress site that you want to import as a template:

1. Under Plugins, install the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin
2. After installation, click the All-in-One WP Migration tab in the WordPress dashboard. Select **Export**.

## Under Website Standard/Pro > Templates tab:

1. Create a new template by duplicating or editing an existing template.
2. Edit the template and go into the WordPress dashboard.
3. Under Plugins, install the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin
4. After installation, go to the All-in-One WP Migration tab in the WordPress dashboard. Select **Import** to import the exported site from above.
5. Go back to the Template Overview page and click on the **Publish as Template** or **Update Template button** to save your template.

## Best practices to ensure your templates load fast and run smoothly:

1. Keep templates simple.
2. Avoid installing too many plugins on your template. Try installing no more than 30 plugins.
3. Avoid uploading a lot of large media files to the templates.
4. **Remember that templates are just a starting point for creating your client's website; additional media and plugins can be installed or uploaded directly to the individual sites for further customization.**
