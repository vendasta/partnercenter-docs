A website can be exported using the [All in One Migration plugin](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/). If the website is no longer active in Website Standard/Pro, our Support team can be contacted to share a backup file. We will hold on to website files for a specific amount of time after a website has been canceled ([learn more here](/vendasta-products/applications-marketplace/website-pro/what-happens-to-my-website-when-i-cancel-website-pro)).

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpWxCeUWBOk) for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to export your website.
