title: Does Website Pro perform server rate limiting on requests?

Website Pro has built-in rate limiting in place for all our hosted sites. We apply rate limiting on all requests with some exceptions at 20 r/s with a 20 requests buffer. This means that each IP can send at most 40 requests within a second, and excessive requests will be rejected with status code 429.

There are some exceptions that we don't rate limit if the request is:

- a static file request, such as an image or a JS file
- a PHP GET request
- wp-admin/admin-ajax.php request

This should help us provide better protection from malicious traffic with real traffic unaffected.
