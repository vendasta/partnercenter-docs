When importing sites into Website Pro it is recommended that you use [All-in-One WP Migration Plugin](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/). However, the free version of this plugin has size limitations (64MB maximum). If you want to import a site larger than 64MB into Website Pro, you have a couple of options:

### **Option 1**

If your site is under 512MB, you can [download the plugin](https://import.wp-migration.com/) to your computer, then [install](https://help.servmask.com/knowledgebase/install-instructions-for-file-extension/) the plugin. This version allows you to migrate sites up to 512MB for free.

### **Option 2**

Buy the [All-in-One WP Migration Unlimited Extension](https://servmask.com/products/unlimited-extension) for $69 (this is a one-time cost that can be used on unlimited sites) OR You can reach out to [support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com) or Live chat to upload the Plugin for free. 

### **Option 3**
