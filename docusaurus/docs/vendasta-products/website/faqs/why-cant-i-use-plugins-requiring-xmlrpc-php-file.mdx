### **What Is Xmlrpc.php?**

This file allows you to access your WordPress site remotely when you don't have a computer nearby.

## **Why can't I use plugins requiring XMLRPC.php?**

Our development team has found that enabling plugins requiring XMLRPC.php will leave sites vulnerable to attack. Due to these security concerns, we have disabled this function on the Website Standard and Website Pro products.

### **Affected Plugins**

An example of a plugin that requires an XMLRPC.php file for communication would be the **Jetpack** (most Jetpack features require the file activated) plugin or **Zapier** integration.
