Partner admin users are now able to hide the **Advanced Tools tab** on the Website dashboard from their clients. All Partner admin users will still be able to see this tab and use the advanced tools.

Hiding the Advanced Tools tab will remove the ability for your *clients* to access PhpMyAdmin, SFTP, PHP Logs, and the Advanced WordPress login.

### How to hide the advanced tools tab

To hide the Advanced Tools a partner admin user must go to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Products > Website.**

Switch to the ***Product info*** tab > Click on **Admin tools** > Select **Product Settings**, from here, a user can turn off the **Show Advanced Features** toggle. If deselected, the Partner's clients will no longer be able to access the Advanced Tools tab in the Website product.
