While Website Pro fully supports WordPress short-codes, it does not support PHP short-codes (`<?` at the top of a file). Support for these has been [removed from PHP as of 7.0](http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php) as it can conflict with other types of files (such as XML).

Generally, it is recommended to use `<?php ` instead, as this will help the system know to treat the file as PHP code. If your site currently uses PHP short-code, you can use a program (such as Notepad++) to find and replace all instances of the short-code.
