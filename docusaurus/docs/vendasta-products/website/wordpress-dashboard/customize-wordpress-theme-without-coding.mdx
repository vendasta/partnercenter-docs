- Change the primary colors, background colors, and font styles.

### **Step 4: Modify Your Homepage Layout**

1. Navigate to **Homepage Settings** in the Customizer.
2. Choose between: 
   - Displaying your latest posts.
   - Using a static homepage.

### **Step 5: Add Widgets**

1. Go to the **Widgets** section.
2. Drag and drop widgets into the desired sidebar or footer area.
3. Preview how they look in real time.

### **Step 6: Customize the Menu**

1. In the Customizer, select **Menus**.
2. Create, edit, or rearrange your menu items.
3. Assign the menu to a location (e.g., header or footer).

### **Step 7: Save and Publish**

Once satisfied with your changes, click the **Publish** button at the top of the Customizer to save your updates.

### **Tips for a Smooth Experience**

- **Test Responsiveness:** Check how your site looks on mobile and tablet views using the device preview option in the Customizer.
