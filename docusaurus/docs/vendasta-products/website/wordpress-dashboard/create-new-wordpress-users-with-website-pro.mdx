To create WordPress users using Website Pro, you must create a Business App user and a WordPress user will get automatically created. Users are identified by email address.

The Business App email used will be the one associated with their WordPress login. All users created in Business App will be assigned the Administrator role in WordPress by default. If you have existing WordPress users, they will need a Business App user profile created with the **same emails** to be able to log in.

**Example:** You want to give Bob access to your WordPress website. You create him a Business App user with the email bob@email.com. When he goes to the WordPress dashboard via Website Pro, he will be logged in as an Administrator as the user bob@email.com.
