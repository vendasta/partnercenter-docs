Vendasta's **Website Standard** is designed to help your clients conduct their business online and stay connected to the communities they serve.

We've designed Website Standard, an easy-to-use eCommerce solution, specifically to help your local business clients transition their business online and maintain service in the current climate. Website Standard is a simplified version of our Website Pro product that includes the Divi Builder and WooCommerce plugins pre-installed. Website Standard is free to any Partners on a paid subscription tier.

Like our other Standard offerings through the Product Led Growth program, Website Standard will have limited functionality in comparison to Website Pro.

To add Website Standard to your Store, go to **Marketplace > Discover Products** and search for the Website product. Click **Start Selling**, and click **Done** to begin offering Website Standard in your public Store.

At Vendasta, we're dedicated to helping local businesses thrive. In response to the difficulties local businesses everywhere are now facing, our priority is to #ProtectLocal. Many small businesses, particularly those without websites or online stores, have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisisâ€”for many, the choice is either to move the business online or to close entirely.

For many small business owners, moving online can seem expensive, time-consuming, or virtually impossible. Website Standard will help your small business clients transition to online businesses, including building online stores and handling transactions digitally.

Website Standard retains the core functionality of Website Pro, our WordPress web hosting product, with features that allow your clients to quickly build and easily manage their own eCommerce-ready website using WordPress.

**Website Standard includes:**

- Easy-to-use eCommerce using the pre-installed WooCommerce plugin. Simply set up and add products to the store to start selling!
- Divi Builder - a visual website builder plugin for WordPress that makes designing a website simple and low-code
- Seven website templates to simplify the design process
- Secure WordPress hosting on the Google Cloud platform
- Daily website backups
- A free SSL certificate to secure online transactions
- Built-in reporting on-site traffic, including popular pages, and site speed
