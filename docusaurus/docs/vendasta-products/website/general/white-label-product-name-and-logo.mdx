Partners (depending on [subscription tier](https://www.vendasta.com/pricing/)) who are selling Vendasta's Website product in their marketplace, are able to white-label the product name and logo. This means that partners can brand, market, and sell it as their own solution.

At Vendasta we want to make our Partners the trusted local experts in their communities and the ability to white-label our marketing solutions is a big part of that.
