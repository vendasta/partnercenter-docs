# Hide Vendasta's pre-built templates from clients

To prevent your clients from accessing the pre-built templates included in the initial Website Pro setup, follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the **Product Info** tab.
2. Click on **Admin Tools**.
3. Select **Product Settings**.

Within the **Product Settings** section, you'll see an option labeled **Show Included Templates**. Toggle this setting off to hide the default pre-built templates from your clients. Disabling this option ensures that clients will no longer see or have access to these templates.

**Here's an illustration of the setting in action:**
