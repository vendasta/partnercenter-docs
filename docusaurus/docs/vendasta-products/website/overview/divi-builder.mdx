# Edit your site with Divi Builder

Getting your business up and selling is possible with Website Standard. This powerful product allows you to quickly and easily create a website and online store powered by WordPress and WooCommerce. To make the transition to ecommerce seamless, we also have a visual builder, called Divi Builder, within every Website Standard account. This allows you to design and create beautiful websites without having to write a single line of code.

Before we jump in, let's make sure we're familiar with Divi Builder.

Divi Builder is a WordPress plugin that allows you to insert, remove, and edit content blocks on the front end of your website. It boasts unlimited layout possibilities and its fluid content areas are perfect for a responsive design approach. It allows those site owners with little or no design, or development experience, to create beautiful sites, with a simple drag-and-drop interface.

Let's start editing your website using Divi Builder!

## Accessing Divi Builder

On the Website Standard/Pro dashboard, click the "Edit My Site" button to start editing the front end, or the content of your website.

## Editing text and images on your website

- It's time to customize your site! Let's start with text elements. Click on the text box you'd like to edit and start making changes.
- Alternatively, when you hover over an element, a small dark toolbar will appear. Click on the **gear icon** to pull up a window that provides more options for editing and customization. Click on the window's green checkmark to save any changes.

- This same process also works with any buttons on the page, however, as buttons have more options, you'll need to open the editing modal to further customize it. You can do this by double-clicking the button or opening it by clicking the gear icon in the same way that you did with the text box.
- Now it's time for images. Many templates will have a large picture set as the background or banner across the top of the website. To change the image, simply hover over it (while not interfering with text or other elements) and double-click. An editing modal should pop up. Click on the "**Background**" section. Your current background image should be showing. Click the garbage can icon to delete the placeholder image and then click "**Add image.**" You can either drag the image from a file on your computer or click to browse your files.

- To edit other images on the site, simply double-click the image and replace it with your own.

## Adding new elements to your website

You may want to add additional elements to a page or section. To do this, click the blue "**+**" icon that appears when hovering between sections or at the end of a section. This will open up Divi's content library where you can choose from various elements including text, images, buttons, blurbs, and more complex modules.

## Saving your changes

Remember to save your changes frequently. You can save your work by clicking the purple disk icon at the bottom of the screen, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac).

## Exiting the editor

When you're finished editing, click the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) at the bottom of the screen and select "Exit Visual Builder" to return to the normal view of your site.
