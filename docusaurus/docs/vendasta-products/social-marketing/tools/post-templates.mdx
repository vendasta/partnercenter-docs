In Social Marketing, you have the ability to create custom templates and save them to reuse via the composer. Once a new post is crafter, you will have the option to save it as a template for a future post.

### **How do post templates work?**

Once you are in the Social Marketing composer, select to the template icon to select which template you would like to use.

You can select the template that best suits your communication needs.

When you clicks on "**Copy to Clipboard**" the image will populate the media section of the composer and the text will be copied. ***You will need to paste it into the text area of the composer and add any specific business details.***

Once you have added your own voice and spin on the template, you will be able to schedule or post the templated post as usual.

To create your own template, you will need to compose your desired post and click in the bottom left corner to **Save as Template.**
