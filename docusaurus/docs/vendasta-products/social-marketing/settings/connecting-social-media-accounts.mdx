To post to social media accounts, users must first connect their accounts in Social Marketing.

:::note
It is recommended that any digital agencies connect accounts in an incognito/private browsing session. Social networks will generally try to connect the account you are already logged in as. Using an incognito/private browsing session will prevent those accounts from being used accidentally.
:::

### Connecting your accounts

1. From Social Marketing, select **Settings > Connect Accounts**
   ![Social Marketing Settings](/img/social-marketing/settings/connecting-accounts/social-settings.jpg)

From here you can begin adding your social accounts by selecting **+** next to the relevant selection.

### Facebook

1. Select **+** to be taken to the Facebook Login screen. Enter your Facebook admin login credentials. If Facebook logs you in directly, please ensure you are logging in with the correct account with Admin privileges. To avoid errors, try completing this process in an incognito window - Facebook will prompt you to enter the credentials.

You need to make sure that the name next to "Continue" is the right Facebook account that you're logging in with, i.e., the Facebook account that has Admin permission on the page.

**_Select 'Reconnect.'_**

2. It will take you to a page similar to the one below.

:::note
Note: Make sure to select **'All Pages'** as indicated in the screenshot below, and not just the page you want to connect to. This will not bring in all of your pages, however, it is required for the API to successfully connect.
:::

If the page is not here, make sure the account you logged in with is the one you have the page permissions on.

2. Enter your LinkedIn login information, and select **Allow access**.
