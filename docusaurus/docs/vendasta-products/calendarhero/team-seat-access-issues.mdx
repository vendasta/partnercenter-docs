# Why is the CalendarHero user not able to access the additional team seat?

To assign a team seat, the user will need to log into the Business App > CalendarHero with the user to who the team seat will be assigned. A team seat will be automatically assigned to any user who logs in via the Business App so long as there is an available open seat and they have not already been assigned a seat previously.

Please note that impersonation is not allowed when using CalendarHero.
