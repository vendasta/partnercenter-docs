Users of Advertising Intelligence that have the Advanced Reporting add-on, can select specific conversion metrics for their Facebook advertising campaigns.

### How does it work?

With the Advanced Reporting add-on activated:

1. Select an **Account** in **Partner Center**
2. Go to **Advertising Intelligence > Settings.**
3. Below the connected Facebook Ads account, select **Conversion Metrics**.
4. In the drop-down menu, select the conversion metrics you would like to display for this account. Website Conversions will be selected as the default conversion to display.
5. Select as many conversions as you would like to include in the campaign reporting. The selected conversions will directly affect the conversion number reported in the product and in the Executive Report.

   If the account does not have Advanced Reporting activated, the user can upgrade by selecting **Purchase Advanced Reporting** from the Overview or Settings page in the product. A Partner can also upgrade this product on behalf of their customer from Partner Center.
