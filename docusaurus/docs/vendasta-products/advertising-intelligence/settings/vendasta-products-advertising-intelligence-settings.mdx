# Admin Settings vs User Settings

In Advertising Intelligence, there are two levels of settings that control how the product functions:

1. **Admin Settings**: Configured by account administrators, these settings apply across the entire account
2. **User Settings**: Configured by individual users, these settings are specific to each user's experience

## Admin Settings

Admin settings can only be accessed by users with the Admin role. These settings control account-wide configurations and determine which features are available to all users within your organization.

### Accessing Admin Settings

To access Admin Settings:

1. Navigate to Advertising Intelligence
2. Click on the **Settings** icon in the upper right corner
3. Select **Admin Settings** from the dropdown menu
