Primary Category field: An enhancement for businesses aiming to refine their online presence. Businesses can designate their core specialization, aligning with industry standards observed by Google and Apple. Ten categories may be added; the Primary and expanded Additional categories will sync out to our Listing Sync Pro and our Citation Builder partners.

### How Do Primary Business Categories Work?

**Automatic Set-Up**: For most businesses, we streamline the process by automatically setting the primary category based on data sourced from Google. This ensures accuracy and saves valuable time.

**Partner Collaboration**: In cases where automatic setup isn't feasible, or if there's a discrepancy between our system and Google's primary category, we leverage the expertise of you, our Partners. Through the Local SEO admin dashboard, Partners can view the categories set on a business, and see what is set on their Google listing. From there you can select the most suitable primary category for the business.

**API Partners:** The first category sent for a location will be used as the Primary Category.

This feature not only enhances business visibility but also optimizes their online presence for maximum impact.

### How to Use Primary Business Categories

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Products > Local SEO.**
2. Click Admin View Dashboard.
3. Go to the Category Management tab.
4. Select the appropriate Primary categories if applicable.
