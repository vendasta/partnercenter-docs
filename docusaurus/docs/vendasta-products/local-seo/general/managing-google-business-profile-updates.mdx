Vendasta enables Partners to review and manage updates to their clients' Google Business Profiles (GBP) directly within the Admin portal. This feature gives Partner's control over GBP updates, ensuring the information displayed aligns with the clients' preferences and maintains consistency across platforms.

## How It Works

When Google updates a client's GBP, you'll see these updates listed in the Admin portal. You can then take the following actions:

- **Approve Changes**: Accept Google's updates, which will sync the updated information across your client's GBP and any other publishers connected through Local SEO.
- **Reject Changes**: Reject Google's updates, which will trigger a new sync to republish the original data you or your client have deemed correct.

This process ensures accuracy while adhering to Google's Terms of Service, which require user involvement to overwrite GBP data programmatically.

## FAQs

### Q: Why can't updates be automatically pushed to Google?

**A:** Google's Terms of Service prohibit automatic overwrites of GBP data. To ensure compliance, all updates must be reviewed and manually approved or rejected by a user.

### Q: What is required to enable this feature?

**A:** To see GBP updates in the Admin portal, the following conditions must be met:

1. The client's GBP must be authenticated.
2. Local SEO must be active.
3. **Sync** must be enabled for the business.

### Q: Why is this feature available for Partners but not for clients?

**A:** Most Partners manage GBP updates as part of their services for their clients. Consolidating this functionality in the Admin portal allows Partners to manage updates for multiple businesses more efficiently.
