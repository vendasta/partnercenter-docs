The Admin View in our Local SEO product has been a powerful tool for Partners, offering the ability to adjust product settings, view sync statuses across locations, and identify discrepancies between Primary Categories set by partners and Google.

Now, we've introduced a convenient enhancement for Partner Admin usersâ€”a direct access point to the Local SEO Admin Dashboard from within the product interface. Partner Admins can now easily navigate to the Admin Dashboard using the new Admin button located in the product's sidebar.

### **How to Access the Local SEO Admin Dashboard**

1. Navigate to Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select Account > Local SEO
2. In the sidebar of the Local SEO product, locate and click on the new **Admin** button in the left-hand panel.
