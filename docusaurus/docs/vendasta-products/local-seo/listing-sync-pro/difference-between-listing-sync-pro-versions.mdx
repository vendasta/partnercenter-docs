## Additional Information

**With Yext LSP, will it create Yelp, Bing, and Yahoo listings if they don't already exist?**

All publishers should create new profiles, but with data aggregation, it is a blind submission, so it's really up to the publisher if they create a listing but generally speaking they will.
