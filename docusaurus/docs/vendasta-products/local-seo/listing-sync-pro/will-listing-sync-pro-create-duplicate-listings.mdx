# Will Listing Sync Pro create duplicate listings?

Listing Sync Pro should not create duplicate listings.

We automatically search for and remove duplicate listings. If you ever find a duplicate that we didn't, please contact [support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com) and we'll coordinate with the Listing Sync Pro service provider to remove them.

**Please Note:** Listing Sync Pro powered by Yext does not support automatic duplicate suppression.
