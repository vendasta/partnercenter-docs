# Which listing sources should be claimed first?

We encourage everyone to claim at least Google, Bing, Yelp, and Yellowpages (the Big Four.) Please check out the following link to [The Big Four Playbook](/files/listing-sync-pro/The_Big_4_Playbook.pdf), which offers detailed instructions on how to claim from each source.

Please keep in mind that these sites are ever-changing. We have compiled this data to be as recent as possible. If you notice something is out-of-date, please let us know.
