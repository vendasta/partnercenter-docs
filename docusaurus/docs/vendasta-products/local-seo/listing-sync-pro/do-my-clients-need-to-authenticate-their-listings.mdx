description: Information about listing authentication requirements for Listing Sync Pro versus Local SEO Standard
---

With Listing Sync Pro, your clients aren't required to authenticate their listings for any of the sites that are managed by the Listing Sync Pro service provider.

However, with Local SEO Standard (i.e. Facebook, Google Business Profile, and X), your clients must authenticate their accounts to sync their business info to those listings.
