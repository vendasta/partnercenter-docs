# Will my client's listing be syndicated if they share the same phone number or address with another company?

The Vendasta platform helps you prepare your business' data in a format that is accepted by the data providers, however, the data providers, as well as the 300+ listing and citation sources, will ultimately determine what they accept or reject.

The most important element is that your client uses their own unique, local phone number. It is unlikely that two different businesses will share the exact same phone number. As a rule of thumb, use the number you would dial to contact that business directly.

The data providers verify your client's address with USPS who will then provide the data providers with the correct location information. This will often ensure that no two addresses are the same.
