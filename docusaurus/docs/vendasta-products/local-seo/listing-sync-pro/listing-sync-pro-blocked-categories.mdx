# Listing Sync Pro powered by Yext: Blocked Categories

For a few Service Area Business types, Yext is unable to publish new listings.

## Adult:

Yext will never create Adult listings, but we will claim adult listings unless the publisher asks us not to.

## Locksmiths, Garage Doors, Movers:

Due to the behavior of service-area businesses (i.e. the frequent inability to verify the business's location and the predominance of spam listings), our premium publishers have made the decision to block this category from their directories. This applies to businesses categorized as Locksmiths, Garage & Overhead Doors, and Movers.

Any existing listings can still be claimed, but the following list blocks Yext from creating new listings on their platform.
- Bing
- Citysearch
- Mapquest
- Foursquare
- ShowMeLocal
- Superpages
- Yahoo
- Yelp
- Blocked completely from:
- Apple 
- HERE (Nokia)
- TomTom

**Note that this list is subject to change as Yext updates its listing sources. Please reach out to [support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com) to request more information about a particular source.**

## Changing Yext Listing Categories

If the Categories maintained in the business profile do not match with those in the Yext dashboard, Yext sources will fail to sync. On clicking a message shows up as "One or more of your Business Categories are invalid."

Once you go to the Yext dashboard, you can change the Primary Category as the relevant alternative to the business profile category.

![Yext Category Selection](/img/vendasta-products-local-seo-listing-sync-pro/yext-category-selection.jpg)

For example, "Local Services > IT Services & Computer Repair" is a suggested alternate category for "Information and Communication Technology" by Yext.

However, changes should be made to the business profile as well.

Once the changes are made, syncing will start immediately.

> For acceptable categories in the Yext dashboard, please refer to this category list, and maintain the categories in business details as per the list.
