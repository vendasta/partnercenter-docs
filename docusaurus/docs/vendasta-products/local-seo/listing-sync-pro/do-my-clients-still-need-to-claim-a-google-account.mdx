description: Information about claiming Google Business Profile listings and how it relates to Listing Sync Pro
---

Neither Listing Sync/Listing Sync Pro nor Citation Builder will automatically claim a business's Google profile. Google requires the business to use the official Google Business Profile dashboard to claim a listing. The same requirement applies to the Google Business Profile integrations offered by other digital marketing vendors.
