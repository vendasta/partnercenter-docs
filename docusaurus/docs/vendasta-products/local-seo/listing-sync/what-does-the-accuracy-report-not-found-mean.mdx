The "Accuracy Report" column showcases our independent reporting system. When a listing source is added, our system pushes the Business Profile data to that listing directory. The listing directory can then communicate back to our systems, letting us know that the data was accepted, rejected, or published onto their systems. The "Accuracy Report" column will then report back on that data.

When the Accuracy Report column displays "Not found," this means that there was no good listing match found by our systems.
