In order to get the most value out of Listing Sync Pro, make sure your Business Profile data is filled out completely and 100% accurate. Ensure you select a primary category as well as two secondary categories. Ensure your Google Business Profile stays optimized every month. You can do this on behalf of your client or you can do this through a managed service like [Google Business Profile Optimization](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-6GLFKDNCV3LTHTRZ6DDXLJN7MLVBBWGW). Ensure the client's business address is searchable by doing a quick Google search of their address. Ensure the phone number is accurate.

Our system syncs data that helps your clients get found, like NAP data (Name, Address, Phone number), as well as the website URL. We also send additional attributes to help customers choose your clients. These attributes include payment methods, business logos, primary photos, long/short descriptions, and social media URLs. It is at the discretion of each listing source which of these attributes to display. Keeping the NAP data and attributes updated is key in helping customers find your clients online.
