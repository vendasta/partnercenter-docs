# What does the status "Synced" mean for Listings?

The "Status" column shows which stage the listing source is in during the syncing process. If the status shows "Synced," the listing source has communicated back to our system that the business listing has been updated.

The "Accuracy Report" column is our independent reporting system and will report back on the accuracy of that data. If the "Accuracy Report" shows "Accurate," the listing source is live on that directory with 100% data accuracy.
