The "Accuracy Report" column showcases our independent reporting system. When a listing source is added, our system pushes the Business Profile data to that listing directory. The listing directory then communicates back to our systems, letting us know that the data was accepted, rejected, or published onto their systems. The "Accuracy Report" column will then report back on that data.

An "In progress" status shows that the listing data is being updated on the listing source. For this reason, you may see a source stay in that "In progress" state for quite some time.
