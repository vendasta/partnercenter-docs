Clients with multiple Facebook, Instagram, or X pages connected to the platform can view and select exactly which social page the data syncs to. Please note that the Instagram source selection does not have an edit button because it is managed by the Facebook source selection.

### **How do Multiple Social Connections work in Local SEO?**

If a client has connected multiple social pages through the Business App or a product like [Reputation Management](/vendasta-products/reputation-management) or [Social Marketing](/vendasta-products/social-marketing), they will see those accounts reflected in [Local SEO](/vendasta-products/local-seo).

On the Listing Sync tab found within Local SEO, click on the desired source. From here, the side panel will appear, and you can select which of the connected pages you would like to sync to. Select the 'Sync to' button, and you are set!
