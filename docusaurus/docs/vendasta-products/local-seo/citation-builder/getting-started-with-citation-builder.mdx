Once inside Citation Builder, clients will see how their business profile and **NAP data** (Name, Address, Phone Number) are being submitted to data aggregators.

#### **Key Setup Steps for SMB Clients:**

1. **Complete the Business Profile**
   - Ensure essential details are accurate:
     - Business name
     - Address
     - Phone number
     - Website
     - Business category
   - Keeping information up to date is critical for local SEO rankings.

2. **Data Submission to Aggregators**
   - Citation Builder automatically submits business information to **TransUnion's Neustar/Localeze** and **Foursquare**.
   - These aggregators distribute data to **hundreds of directories, search engines, and mapping services**.

3. **Tracking Citations**
   - As directories reference data aggregators, the business's online citations will expand over time.
   - Clients can track this by clicking **View All Citations**.

Google cross-checks business details across multiple sources. Consistent information improves rankings and builds credibility. Businesses gain **valuable backlinks** from trusted directories, strengthening their SEO.

It typically takes **6 to 8 weeks** for data aggregators to process and distribute business information.

Citation Builder operates continuously to:

- Maintain accurate business data.
- Protect against outdated or conflicting information.
- Refresh client NAP data **every month**.

**Making Updates:** Clients can update business details (e.g., address or phone number) anytime in their **Business Profile**. Citation Builder will automatically push these updates to aggregators.

By using Citation Builder, businesses ensure their online presence remains accurate, visible, and optimized for local search.
