All Vendasta customers with service area businesses have the ability to add multiple geographic areas for which they serve.

## How to Sync Multiple Service Areas for Service Area Businesses?

In Partner Center, navigate to **Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select account > Edit >** Under **Business Info**, a checkbox for Service Area Businesses can be found. Clicking on the checkbox will prompt two options, hiding the business address and only showing service areas, or showing the business address in addition to showing the service areas. In the text box below, multiple service areas can now be entered, all of which will be syncing to Local SEO or Listing Sync Pro providers if either product is active.
