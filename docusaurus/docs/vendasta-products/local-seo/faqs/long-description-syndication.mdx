## What is Long Description Syndication?

The listings team is working hard to offer you and your clients more value and more clarity within Local SEO. As part of the first slice of our commitment to make continuous improvements to the listing suite, we'll start by adding new Google Business Profile (GBP) fields and attributes to our platform as well as making improvements to existing fields.

## How does Long Description Syndication work?

Business information entered in the "Long Description" field will now be synced to the connected Google Business Profile (GBP). This field can be found under **Accounts > Manage Accounts > The specific account > Local SEO > Business Profile > Marketing > Long Description**. If there is already content in this field, it will be published to the account's GBP. If this field is left blank, no changes will be made to the account's existing GBP.

Customers are 2.7 times more likely to consider a business reputable if it has a complete Google Business Profile. The long description gives a great way to do so by telling prospective customers what sets you or your client's business apart from the rest. 

Recommended items to include: 

- What kind of services or products the business offers
- Company history/values
- Anything other valuable information that customers should know about the business 

Keep this content business-focused, leaving out anything related to pricing, promotions, or any type of content that frequently changes. Please ensure that you do not exceed 750 characters and that there are no URLs or HTML code present in this field. 

## FAQs

**Will this data override what my client has entered directly in their Google Business Profile's description field?**

If your client has connected their Google Business Profile to the Vendasta platform and the "long description" field found within the Business Profile is blank, any existing content in your client's GBP will remain unchanged. If there is existing content in the platform's "long description" field, this content will be syndicated to their GBP.

Please ensure that any data present in this field is an accurate representation of the business description and is up-to-date.
