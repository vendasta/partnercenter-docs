3. Once your client has connected their Google Business Profile account, they will be able to view their Google Insight reporting for important online consumer activity data such as:

- **Searches** - how customers search for your client's business
- **Customer views** - where customers view your client's business on Google
- **Customer actions** - the most common actions that customers take on your client's business listing
