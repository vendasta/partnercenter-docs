# How do I force the deactivation of a Local SEO Add-on?

Partner Center admins of Local SEO can deactivate a cancelled Citation Builder or Listing Sync Pro add-on that is under a contract and has not yet expired.

The syndication services with the aggregator will terminate, and the Partner will continue to be billed until the end of the commitment. This deactivation ensures clients with overdue payments will not benefit from unpaid services.

### How to force deactivate a cancelled Local SEO add-on

1. In **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts**, select the appropriate account.
2. On the account details page, under "Products" find the cancelled add-on you want to deactivate.
3. Next to the add-on, click the kebab menu **> Force Deactivation.**
4. In the pop-up, select "Deactivate Now" to proceed with the action.

Forcing deactivation will result in the add-on being removed from the Partner Center and syndication services ending. As a Partner, you will be billed until the end of the commitment.

This feature will not be visible for active (as in not yet cancelled) Citation Builder and Listing Sync Pro products and is not available for any other Marketplace product or add-on.
