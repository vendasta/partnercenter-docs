## What are SMART Keyword Suggestions?

With Local SEO Pro, you can track SEO ranking on up to 15 keywords of your choosing in Google organic search and Google Maps, but choosing the right keywords to track can be challenging. Suggested keywords will help you track the terms that matter most to help your clients stand out in local searches and gain an edge over competitors.

## How do SMART Keyword Suggestions work?

We use a business website to find seed keywords to explore relevant alternatives. We then consider both competitiveness and search volume to show which additional keywords a business could explore to get found in local search results. They can be found by navigating to **Local SEO > Keyword Tracking > Add Keyword.**
