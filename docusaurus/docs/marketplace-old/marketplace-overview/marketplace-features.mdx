# Marketplace - Overview

The Vendasta Marketplace optimizes how digital products are sold to local businesses. Instantly take new products to market, consolidate vendor relationships, and provide immediate value from a single customer login.

## Why is Marketplace important?

- **Streamline sales** — having one place to sell all products and services to clients makes selling and the delivery and fulfillment of those solutions that much easier and ensures nothing falls through the cracks. The Marketplace integrates with the entire all-in-one platform allowing business to be conducted all in one platform — from sales, marketing, billing, and fulfilling.

- **Product-led growth** — having an online marketplace with products and services can allow Partners to be hands-off with their clients, allowing them to explore and self-order new products and solutions without needing to spend precious man-hours directly selling to your clients.

- **Grow your revenue** — with a white-label marketplace software solution, Partners will have access to over 250+ best-in-class products they can resell directly to their clients with one click of a button.

## How to Use Marketplace

- **Discover Products**: Featuring 250+ products and services, Marketplace is the destination for curated solutions aligned with the world's most common local business needs. Partners can easily select what they want to sell.

- **Manage Store**: Share the breadth of offerings online. Partners can curate a white-label store on their website to generate leads and showcase everything they have to sell. Making sure they are always open for business.

- **Create Product**: Partners can take everything they sell already and funnel it through the Marketplace. Integrate products and services into one place for customers to see all offerings.
