# Assign a Salesperson to the Store

To assign a Salesperson to your store, please head to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Manage Store > Contact Form > Select a Salesperson in the Dropdown.**

If you don't see a Salesperson in the dropdown, then there is no Salesperson in the account or the market selected.
