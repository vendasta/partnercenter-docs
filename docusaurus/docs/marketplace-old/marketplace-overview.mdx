# Marketplace - Overview

## What is Marketplace?

Marketplace is a centralized platform that optimizes how digital products are sold to local businesses. You can instantly take new products to market, consolidate vendor relationships, and provide immediate value from a single customer login. The platform integrates with the entire all-in-one system, allowing business to be conducted in one place — from sales and marketing to billing and fulfillment.

## Why is Marketplace important?

Marketplace streamlines your business operations and revenue growth in several key ways:

- **Streamline sales** — Having one place to sell all products and services to clients makes selling and the delivery and fulfillment of those solutions easier and ensures nothing falls through the cracks. The marketplace integrates with the entire platform, allowing all business operations to be conducted from one location.

- **Product-led growth** — An online marketplace with products and services allows you to be hands-off with your clients, letting them explore and self-order new products and solutions without requiring direct sales time.

- **Grow your revenue** — With a white-label marketplace solution, you have access to over 250+ best-in-class products that you can resell directly to your clients with one click.

- **Centralized management** — Manage all your enabled products, track growth metrics, configure pricing, and handle customer purchases from a single dashboard.
