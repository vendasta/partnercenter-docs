The Vendasta App in Zapier allows Partners to connect their Vendasta CRM to several 3rd Party systems using Zapier. Partners can select any 3rd Party system available in Zapier as a Trigger which would initiate an action in the Vendasta CRM

## Step 1: Selecting the Trigger

In this step, you can select the trigger that initiates an action in your workflow. As an example, a New Customer in Quickbooks Online can be used as a trigger, however, you can choose from various other triggers available in Zapier.

## Step 2: Choosing the Action

After selecting the trigger, you'll need to choose the app that will carry out your desired action. In this scenario, that app would be the Vendasta App. This means that whenever a New Customer is added in Quickbooks online, an action would be executed in the Vendasta CRM. As part of the Vendasta App in Zapier various actions are possible.

## Step 3: Choosing the Action

In this step, you'll set the action to be performed when the trigger event happens. For this scenario, the action is to Create or Update a contact in the Vendasta CRM.

Remember, you can change the action anytime by clicking on the dropdown menu and choosing a different option. After selecting the action, click "Continue" to proceed to the next step.

## Step 4: Signing In

In this step, you'll connect your Vendasta account. Click on "Sign in" to be redirected to the login page. Here, you'll enter your Partner ID or the Account ID of the SMB you're setting up Zapier for and grant the necessary permissions. After this, you'll be automatically redirected back to Zapier.

**Note:** You only need to complete this process once. In the future, you'll be automatically signed into your account when using the Vendasta App.

## Step 5: Entering the Organization ID

In this step, you will need to enter the Organization ID, which is a mandatory field. This ID is automatically populated based on the Account ID you used when signing in.

## Step 6: Fields to Create or Update - Search Fields

In the "Fields to Create or Update" section, you can input values for the fields you want to create or update. These values can be taken from previous steps in Zapier.

To avoid creating duplicate entries, make sure to provide values for at least one search field. This could be the Email or Phone Number fields, which are provided by default, or any other search field that you can set up in the Advanced section.

## Step 7: Fields to Create or Update - Standard Fields

This section includes a set of standard fields that you can use when creating or updating a Contact. You can populate these fields with values from previous steps in Zapier.

You'll also find an "Additional Fields" dropdown. Use this to add more fields to the "Fields to Create or Update" section. Once added, you can provide values to these fields.

## Step 8: Advanced Section - Additional Search Fields

In the 'Advanced' section, you have the option to refine your contact search. By default, the system searches for contacts by email first, then phone number. However, you can specify additional unique fields to identify contacts during the search.

To do this, use the "Additional Search Fields" dropdown. This allows you to select additional fields in order to perform the search operation. You can list these fields in order of priority for a more tailored search experience.

**Note:** You can only select additional search fields from those present in the "Fields to Create or Update" section. If you want to use a new field, first add it using the "Additional Fields" option in the "Fields to Create or Update" section. After that, you can select it from the "Additional Search Fields" dropdown.

## Step 9 - Advanced Section - Overwrite Existing Data

By default, only fields without any current value in the "Fields to Create or Update" section are updated. If you want to change this and overwrite existing data, use the "Overwrite Existing Data" option.

Click on "Overwrite Existing Data" dropdown to select specific fields that you want to be always overwritten, regardless of whether they are empty or already contain data.

**Note:** Overwriting existing data can be useful in certain scenarios, but it should be used with caution to avoid unintentional data loss.

## Step 10 - Associating a Company

In this step, you have the option to associate a company with the contact you're creating or updating. If you wish to do this, enter the Company ID in the provided text box labeled "Company ID for Association (Optional)".

**Note:** This is an optional step. If you don't have the Company ID at hand, you can leave it blank and proceed to the next step.

## Step 11 - Selecting Return Fields from CRM

After a contact has been created or updated in the CRM, you can choose which fields you'd like to have returned. These fields can be used in later steps of this Zap. 

To select the return fields, Click on the dropdown menu under "Return Fields" and select the specific fields you want to be returned from the CRM.

**Note:** The Contact ID is always included as a return field by default.
