## Integration Example

Consider, for example, a contact in Partner Center named Amy. Amy's contact profile in Partner Center shows no recent activities recorded.

![Contact Profile Before Integration](/img/integrations/quickbooks/contact_profile_before.jpg)

The business creates an invoice for Amy in Quickbooks.

A note is created on Amy's contact profile in Partner Center with details from Quickbooks, including Invoice Number, Contact Name, and Invoice amount.
