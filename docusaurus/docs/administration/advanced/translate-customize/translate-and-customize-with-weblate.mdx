**Q: When are the translation suggestions reviewed?**

A: Typically within 30 days.

**Q: Can I limit my users to only specific languages?**

A: Not at this time

**Q: Why is there HTML in the text content?**

A: In order to help translators read and understand the content, some HTML is kept inline so that sentences aren't split.

**Q: Why are there \{\{curly braces\}\} in the text content?**

A: Curly braces are used in text content to identify where dynamic or parameterized content can be substituted in. The text inside braces should not be modified.

**Q: How do I translate emails?**

A: You can see translatable email templates in the Email Templates project in Weblate.

**Q: How do I translate videos?**

A: You can see translatable video subtitle files in the Video Captions project in Weblate.

**Q: How does Weblate handle plurals, genders, and other declensions?**

A: The tech we are presently using for internationalization does not fully support declensions. We understand the need to support them, and we are actively exploring new technologies that allow us to meet translator requirements.

**Q: What incentives do I get when I help Vendasta translate their platform?**

A: We are exploring how we can reward you for contributing to translations. Be on the lookout for more information in the coming months.

**Q: How can I see how text content is used in the platform in order to suggest better translations?**

A: We know it's challenging to translate text without context, descriptions, and screenshots. We're actively exploring ways to get you the information you need to translate.
