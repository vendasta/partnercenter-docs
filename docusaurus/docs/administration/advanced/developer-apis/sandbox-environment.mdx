# Is there a sandbox environment available for integration testing?

Vendasta offers a sandbox environment for initial development work with new Partners that will be integrating with Vendasta via API and/or SSO. This environment pulls in live data and is an excellent way to perform integration testing. Our Support team is here to answer any of your questions as you do this testing in the sandbox environment, and we will ensure you're comfortable before migrating to the production environment.

Please contact [support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com) for more information.
