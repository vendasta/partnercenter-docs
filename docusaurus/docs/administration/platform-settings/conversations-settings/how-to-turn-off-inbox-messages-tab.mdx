The Inbox Messages tab in the Business App can be turned off from appearing to your clients in Business App - either on a user by user basis, or for all of your accounts within a market.

**WARNING: Removing user access to Inbox will also remove your users ability to use Inbox Pro, Lead capture or SMS messaging features - and is not recommended.**

**To disable Inbox for a specific subset of users:**

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Users.**
2. Click on the checkboxes to select the user(s) you want to modify their feature access > click on 'Bulk Update x users'.
