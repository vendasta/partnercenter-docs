# Why is my favicon not uploading?

To add a favicon, navigate to **Partner Center > Administration > Partner Branding > Favicon.**

**Please note:** All favicons must be an ICO file. For example, instead of image.png or image.jpg, it must be image.ico. If you encounter this error, check the file type and try again.
