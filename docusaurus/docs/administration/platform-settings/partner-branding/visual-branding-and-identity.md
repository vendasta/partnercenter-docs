## What is Visual Branding and Identity?

This white-label capability ensures your brand identity is consistently presented across all customer-facing aspects of the platform, including Business App, email campaigns, and client communications.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Can I completely white-label the platform?</summary>

Yes, the platform offers comprehensive white-labeling capabilities. You can replace logos, colors, company names, and most visual elements. Some limitations may apply based on your subscription tier.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is my favicon not uploading?</summary>

All favicons must be an ICO file. For example, instead of image.png or image.jpg, it must be image.ico. To add a favicon, navigate to **Partner Center > Administration > Partner Branding > Favicon**.

If you encounter an upload error, check the file type and try again. Common issues include:

<details>
<summary>Can I customize the Business App login page?</summary>

You cannot white-label the Business App login page completely. However, if you are using multiple markets with different branding on each, you can use a generic logo for the default branding market.
