### Market Branding Capabilities

Each Market's branding can be customized independently:

To customize market branding:
1. Open **Partner Center > Administration > Partner Branding**
2. Select your target market
3. Configure branding elements specific to that market

### Requesting Markets

To activate Markets for your platform or add additional Markets, contact your Account representative or Support On Demand.
