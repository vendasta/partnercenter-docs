Sales Managers have the ability to see and access **_all_** accounts within their market regardless of the assignee, even if the **'Market-wide access'** configuration is **_turned off_**. While salespeople can only see accounts assigned to them when **'Market-wide access'** is **_turned off_**.

The market-wide access settings can be found in the **Partner Center > Administration > Customize > Sales > Settings.**
