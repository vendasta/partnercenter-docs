Platform customization allows you to control how clients interact with your platform, including purchasing processes, Business App access, and various platform features. These settings help you align the platform experience with your business model and client needs.

- **Controlled Access**: Manage when and how clients can purchase or access features
- **Improved User Experience**: Streamline client interactions and reduce confusion

- Business App contact and communication settings
- Prospect snapshot and account access management
- Client agreement and shopping cart customization
- Listing and review source configuration

## How to Configure Buy-it-Yourself Purchasing

The "BIY" or "Buy-it-Yourself" process allows clients to purchase and activate products independently. However, some partners may find this unsuitable for their business model or cashflow management.

### Understanding Buy-it-Yourself Process

When a client initiates a sales order with successful retail payment, the auto-activation process charges the partner the wholesale total. This efficient process works well for businesses set up for anytime purchases, but may not suit those preferring controlled timing or with variable wholesale account funding.

Products and services offered for free are not part of the BIY experience.

### Building a Custom Purchasing Experience

To create a controlled purchasing workflow:

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Administration > Customize > Sales** dropdown
2. Select **Configure Orders and Sales Processes**
3. Scroll to **Default Content > Custom fields** for Orders

:::info
If you have multiple markets, select your target market before proceeding.

4. Create Order Form questions in the **Administrative Questions** section
5. Mark questions as **required** and **hidden from end users** so only partner users see them
6. When clients click **Buy** and enter payment information, orders will go to *Awaiting Partner Approval* status
7. Use a simple checkbox like "this order is approved" to control timing
8. When ready, fill the field and click **Approve** to process the order

## How to Customize Business App Contact Settings

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Administration > Customize**
2. Go to **General Product Settings > Contact button for Business App users**
3. Choose your preferred contact method:
   - **Email**: Clients will be prompted to send an email
   - **Phone**: Clients will see your phone number
   - **Website**: Direct clients to a specific webpage
   - **Hide**: Remove the contact button entirely

:::warning
