## How to Understand Market Structure

### Market Organization Principles

#### Account Assignment Process
When Markets are activated on your platform:
- **Required assignment**: Each new account must be assigned to a market during creation
- **Dropdown selection**: A market dropdown appears in the Account Create form
- **Default market**: One market represents your company as a whole
- **Additional markets**: Used for segmentation by region, brand, or other criteria

#### User Access and Permissions
Different user types interact with markets differently:

**Business App Users**:
- Assigned permissions to specific accounts rather than entire markets
- See branding from the first account in their list on login
- Branding updates when they select accounts from different markets
- View market-specific branding when accessing products on assigned accounts

**Salespeople**:
- See market-specific branding after logging into their account
- Snapshot Reports display their assigned market's branding
- New accounts automatically created under their assigned market
- Must be assigned to a market (required for salespeople created before Markets activation)

### URL and Portal Management
- **Consistent URLs**: Portal URLs remain consistent with your original setup
- **Custom domains**: Per-market custom domains are currently unavailable
- **Login branding**: Pre-login portals display your white-label branding
- **Market switching**: Branding updates dynamically based on selected accounts

## How to Configure Market-Specific Branding

To customize branding for individual markets:

1. Navigate to `Administration` > `Partner Branding`
2. Use the dropdown in the top-right corner to select:
   - **All Markets**: Apply branding to all markets
   - **Individual Market**: Customize specific market branding
3. Configure logos, colors, and visual elements
4. Save changes for the selected market scope

### Branding Inheritance and Customization
- **Default branding**: Branding created before Markets activation becomes the default for new markets
- **Individual customization**: Each market can have unique visual identity
- **Inheritance model**: New markets inherit default settings but can be modified
- **Consistent elements**: Maintain brand consistency across markets while allowing differentiation

## How to Manage Market Settings and Configuration

### Configure Market-Specific Features

Each market can have its own configuration for various features:

#### Sales Order Settings Configuration
Markets can have customized sales processes:
- **Individual sales processes**: Configure unique workflows per market
- **Order restrictions**: Set market-specific product and sales limitations
- **Process customization**: Tailor sales workflows to market requirements
- **Permission variations**: Different access levels and capabilities per market

#### Beta Program and Feature Management
- **Market-level beta access**: Enable or disable beta features per market
- **Independent settings**: Beta program participation separate from partner-level settings
- **Feature rollouts**: Test new features in specific markets before wider deployment
- **Controlled access**: Manage feature availability based on market readiness

### Restore Market Settings to Defaults

If you need to reset market-specific configurations:

1. Go to `Administration` > `Customize`
2. Click **Markets**
3. Click the edit icon next to the market you want to restore
4. Navigate to **Sales** > **Configure Orders and Sales Processes**

## How to Configure Market-Based Reporting Limits

### Set Market-Specific Snapshot Report Limits

While there's no direct market-wide snapshot limit, you can control reporting per market by configuring salesperson limits within each market:

1. Navigate to `Administration` > `Customize` > `Sales`
2. Switch to the specific market you want to configure
3. Check the **Limit monthly Snapshot Reports** checkbox
4. Set the **Snapshot creation limit** for salespeople in that market
5. Save the configuration

### Understanding Market Report Limits
- **Combined limits**: If multiple salespeople work in a market, the limit is the total maximum all salespeople can create combined
- **Market-specific**: Each market can have different reporting limits
- **Individual tracking**: Each salesperson's usage is tracked separately within the market total
- **Monthly reset**: All limits reset monthly regardless of market configuration
