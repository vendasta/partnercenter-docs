Sales tax rules can be complicated and vary by location. Certain categories of clients, such as government agencies, tribal councils, and NGOs, are exempt from specific taxes, and some digital products might not be taxable. The tax exemption feature allows Partners to accurately bill for products and services, considering the unique nature of each transaction. Exemption rules are automatically applied to sales orders and subscription billing.

### **Exempting Tax from an Item** 

If you have a few digital products or services that are exempt from tax, you can prevent taxes from applying to these individual items. To do so:

1. Navigate to the Tax Rates page in Partner Center under **Administration > Tax Rates**, and select **Item Exemptions**.

4. Click **Save**.

The item will now be exempt from taxation in sales orders and subscriptions.

### **Exempting a Client Account from Tax**

If you're selling to a tax-exempt client, you can prevent taxes from applying to all products sold to that client. To get started:

1. Navigate to the **Tax Rates** page in Partner Center under **Administration > Tax Rates**, and select **Account Exemptions**.

2. Click **Add Account** to add the client account you want to exempt.

3. Select the tax rates from which the account should be exempted. Only tax rates applicable to the client's location will be displayed.

4. Click **Save**.
