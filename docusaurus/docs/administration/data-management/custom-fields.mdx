With the release of Custom Fields, Vendasta Channel Partners will be able to create unique fields to hold the information that you find important for accounts, users, orders, and products. This allows more flexibility in how you segment and personalize your marketing, automate your sales processes, collect payments from clients, and fulfill your work with less effort.

### **Why are custom fields important?**

Depending on who you are working with and how you are working with them, the information that you need to document could be very different from another business' needs. Instead of including every possible combination of data points, Custom Fields allows you to define fields that will be important to you in your day-to-day use of the Vendasta Platform. 

Some examples of ways you might use Custom Fields include:

- Sending a "starter" email campaign to dental offices with less than 100 patients and an "established" email campaign to dental offices with more than 100 patients
- Storing a user's favorite football team so your salespeople have a good icebreaker
- Automatically assigning a salesperson or sales team to an account based on the estimated revenue of the business

### **How do custom fields work?**

**Defining Fields:**

Before information can be stored in a custom field, the field needs to be defined in **Administration > Custom Fields.** When defining a field, you must choose which "object" type will be associated with this data. For example, it makes sense that you want to know the number of hotel rooms associated with an account, but you likely don't need a field for the number of hotel rooms associated with individual users.

After clicking **Create Custom Field**, a **Name** and **Field Type** must be filled out. The field type has a significant effect on the type of data that can be stored in the custom field and how the data can be filtered and sorted.
