The default pipeline includes four stages: "Lead," "Contact," "Qualified," and "Proposal." The default percentage is 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% respectively, and it will show you the revenue forecast based on the percentage of the pipeline stages.

Does the default pipeline not fit your business? Don't worry - you have the flexibility to create custom pipelines and define your forecast percentages.

## How to Create a Pipeline

1. Go to **Partner Center > Administration**, click on **Pipelines**.

2. Here you can edit the existing pipeline, and you can find the option to create a new pipeline by clicking on **Create pipeline**. These stages appear in your Pipeline in order of the probability of success you assign them.
