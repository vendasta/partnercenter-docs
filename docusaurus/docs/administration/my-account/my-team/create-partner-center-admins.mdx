Partner Center Admins access the platform via [partners.vendasta.com](https://partners.vendasta.com). It's a best practice to add all of your agency's key decision-makers, managers, and fulfillment teams as Admins.

**Note:** Be sure to check how many Team Member seats your account has available, as you may be charged for additional seats if you go over your limit of free seats. 

:::note
You can restrict Admins from certain actions in Partner Center, such as creating additional Admins, accessing billing reports, customizing the platform, customizing the marketplace, and managing salespeople.

To create a Partner Center Admin:

1. Go to **Partner Center > Administration > [My Team](https://partners.vendasta.com/my-team)**.
2. Click **Invite Team Member** in the upper right corner of the screen. 
   :::note
   If you do not see the **Invite Team Member** button, you do not possess permission to create new Admins. Please contact a separate Admin at your organization with these permissions, or have them contact our Support On-Demand team.

   c. Select which Markets the Admin should have access to.
4. Once you've confirmed that the information entered is correct, click **Send**.

Once a new Partner Center Admin is created, they will receive a Welcome Email at the email address you entered while creating the team member. The Welcome Email contains a link that allows the Admin to set their password and sign in to Partner Center.
