# What to do when your team member or clients cannot log in

If your team members or clients are having issues logging in, there are several steps you can take to help resolve the problem.

## Check if they've received their login details

When you create a new user in the platform, they should automatically receive an email with their login details. Ask them to check their email (including spam/junk folders) for a message from Vendasta containing their login credentials.

## Ensure they're using the correct login URL

Make sure your team members or clients are using the correct login URL. The login URL is typically in the format: `https://yourcompanyname.vendasta.com`.

## Reset their password

If they've forgotten their password, you can help them reset it:

1. Go to your company's login page
2. Click on "Forgot Password"
3. They'll need to enter the email address associated with their account
4. They'll receive an email with instructions to reset their password

## Contact Support

If the above steps don't resolve the issue, please contact Vendasta Support for further assistance. Be ready to provide the following information:

- The user's email address
- When the user was created
- What error messages (if any) they're receiving when trying to log in
- Screenshots of any error messages
- Whether this is a new issue or if they were able to log in previously
