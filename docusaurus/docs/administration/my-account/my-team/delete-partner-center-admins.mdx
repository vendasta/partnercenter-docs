## Delete a Partner Center Admin

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Administration** > **My Team**
2. Click the <img src="./img/administration/my-team/delete-icon.png" alt="Delete icon" width="20" /> icon next to the **Admin** you want to delete > Select **Delete member.**
3. Things to remember while deleting is if the member needs to be deleted or the Admin role needs to be deleted. If a member is not required to be an Admin anymore, then the Admin role can be denied but checking off the Admin role and NOT delete the member itself.

- It's not possible to delete the user you are currently logged in as.
