### Seat Limits

Seats are people at your company who will be able to use Vendasta. This can include salespeople, marketers, fulfilment professionals, and administrators. Be sure to check how many Team Member seats your subscription tier has available, as you may be charged for additional seats if they go over their limit of free seats. This is usually displayed in a banner at the top of the 'My Team' page.

Partners on Freemium and Free Trial will have seat limits to prevent fraudulent activity:

- Admin - 5 seats
- Salesperson - 5 seats
- Digital Agents - 5 seats
