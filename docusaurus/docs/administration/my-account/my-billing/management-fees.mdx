# Management Fees

On your Vendasta invoice or receipt, you may notice a charge labeled as "Management Fees". This guide explains what these fees are and how they're displayed in your billing information.

## What are Management Fees?

Management fees are charges that apply to certain Vendasta products. These fees appear as separate line items on your invoice, making it easier to identify the additional costs associated with specific products.
