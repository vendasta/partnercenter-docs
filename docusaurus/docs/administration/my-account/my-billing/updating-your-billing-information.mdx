Once complete, select **Save**.

:::note
If you receive a message saying the card has been declined, the likely cause is that your credit card company is blocking the transaction because it is an international payment. Please contact your credit card company and ask them to allow all transactions from Vendasta Technologies Inc.

## Updating existing info

Should you need to update your billing info after it's been entered, you can do so by navigating back into **Partner Center > Administration > My Billing**. Here, click **Edit** on the section you wish to update.

If you update your card when confirming an order in Partner Center it will also update the billing information in **My Billing.**
