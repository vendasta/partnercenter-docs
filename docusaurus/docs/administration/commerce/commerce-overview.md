## How Commerce Management Works Together

### Integrated Financial Workflow
Your commerce management system creates a seamless flow from order creation to payment collection:

3. **Payment Collection**: Payments are processed through your configured payment system
4. **Billing Automation**: Recurring charges are handled automatically based on your default settings
5. **Fulfillment Tracking**: Orders are tracked through completion and delivery

### Configuration Dependencies
Several commerce features work together and require coordinated configuration:

- **Payment processing** must be active before billing automation can collect payments automatically
- **Tax rates** need complete customer addresses to calculate correctly
- **Order templates** require product pricing to generate accurate billing
- **Default billing settings** apply to new accounts but can be overridden individually

### Regional and Compliance Considerations
Commerce management adapts to different regional requirements:

- **Currency support**: Handle multiple currencies based on business location
- **Tax compliance**: Automatically apply appropriate tax rates for customer jurisdictions
- **Payment regulations**: Comply with local payment processing requirements
- **Documentation**: Maintain records for audit and compliance purposes
