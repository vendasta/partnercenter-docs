# Automations available for Conversations

Automate your messaging workflow using the Vendasta platform's automation system. You can use pre-built automations or create your own custom workflows to enhance your communication strategy.

[Manage your automations here](../../automations/my-automations)

### **Examples to try:**

- Send an automatic welcome message when you create a new account
- Alert users when their shopping cart updates with an offer to help
- Thank customers automatically after they make a payment
- Schedule regular business review reminders with your booking link

### **Get started with pre-made templates**

Start quickly with these ready-to-use automation templates - customize them to fit your needs:

- **Welcome Message**: Automatically greet new accounts
- **Sales Activity Tracking**: Log every customer interaction from your team
- **Auto-Response**: Set clear expectations about response times when customers reach out

Find these templates and more in the [Create workflow](../../automations/templates) section.

### **Triggers**

Start your automation workflow with these Conversations-related triggers:

- Message Activity with an Account: 
  - Any message sent or received in a conversation
  - Outgoing messages from your team
  - Incoming messages from external contacts

### **Actions**

Your automation can perform these Conversations-related actions:

- Send a Message 
  - Automatically respond in conversations with personalized messages
  - Messages appear from the assigned salesperson or your company name
  - Include dynamic fields to customize content for each recipient
- Add System Messages 
  - Display status updates or event logs in the chat
  - Visible to all conversation participants
  - Note: System messages don't trigger notifications

### **Importance of rate-limiting**

Since messaging can generate many events quickly, use the **Rate Limiter** step to control how often your automations run:

Example: When tracking sales team outreach, you might want to:
- Log the first message as a sales activity
- Wait for a quiet period (like 24 hours) before logging the next activity

### **Useful actions to combine with Conversations**

Enhance your messaging automations with these additional actions:

- Update account "hotness" levels
- Create follow-up tasks
- Add account tags
- Log sales activities to track team outreach
- Send notifications to team members
