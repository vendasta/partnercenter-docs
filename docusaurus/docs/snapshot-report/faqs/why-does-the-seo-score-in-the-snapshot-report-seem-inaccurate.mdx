Google Search results vary from person to person even when using the same exact keywords as there are multiple factors in the algorithm. While the Snapshot Report makes its best effort to provide objective results, they should be taken as indicative information.

**Some of the factors Google might use to influence a specific search are:**

- • Previous Searches On a Single Device
- • Previously Clicked Links
- • Geographic Location
- • Google Account History
- • Device Being Used
- • Type of Search and Filters Used
- • Paid Ads Present
- • Changes to a website or its content
- • Ongoing experiments with the algorithm
