# Snapshot Report Sections – Ecommerce and Technology

## Why are Ecommerce and Technology important?

- **Competitive Necessity**: As ecommerce continues growing, businesses without online sales capabilities fall behind competitors

### Technology Impact

- **Marketing Effectiveness**: Marketing technology tools help businesses engage customers and generate leads
- **Growth Limitations**: Poor technology choices can hinder SEO efforts and limit business growth potential
- **Solution Opportunities**: Understanding current technology reveals gaps where better solutions can be offered

## What's Included with Ecommerce Assessment?

The Ecommerce section analyzes four critical categories for online business success:

### 3. **Lead Engagement**

**What it includes:**

- Email marketing integration
- Retargeting capabilities

**What it detects:**
- Appointment booking systems
- Calendar integration tools

### Ecommerce Grade Weighting

The ecommerce grade is weighted based on sales professional insights, focusing on areas that matter most:

- **Online Storefront**: **High weight** (most critical for online sales)
- **Online Payments**: **Medium weight** (important for transaction completion)  
- **Lead Engagement**: **Low weight** (helpful but not essential for basic ecommerce)

This weighting helps focus on areas with the greatest impact on online sales success.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Why is it showing an F when my prospect has ecommerce enabled on their website?</summary>

While the system covers main solution providers in each market, the growing and dynamic ecommerce industry may include smaller or custom platforms that aren't recognized. This causes the system to show that nothing was found. The platform may also show "none found" if the ecommerce solution is behind a login page that can't be crawled. If you notice a specific platform missing, contact support to add it to the recognition list.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does 'Lead Engagement' refer to in the ecommerce section?</summary>

Lead engagement scans the website for software that allows businesses to engage with current or recent website visitors. This includes solutions like live chat, retargeting campaigns, email capture forms, and personalized content. For example, showing recent website visitors digital ads featuring items they previously viewed in the online store.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is the ecommerce section automatically enabled?</summary>

The ecommerce section is automatically enabled with default configurations. If you've customized the report in any way, you'll need to manually enable this section for it to appear in Snapshot Reports. This respects existing customizations while allowing new features to be added.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can the technology section identify custom or proprietary systems?</summary>

The technology section identifies widely-used, recognizable platforms and tools. Custom or proprietary systems may not be detected if they don't use standard signatures or technologies. However, the system can often identify underlying frameworks, hosting providers, and common third-party integrations even in custom setups.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I use technology insights to sell solutions?</summary>

Use technology insights to identify gaps in the prospect's current setup, highlight limitations of their current platform (like SEO challenges with certain website builders), propose better alternatives for outdated tools, and demonstrate how technology improvements can drive business growth and efficiency.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if a business doesn't need ecommerce capabilities?</summary>

Not every business needs full ecommerce functionality. Service-based businesses might benefit more from online scheduling and lead engagement tools. Use the ecommerce analysis to identify which components (payment processing, scheduling, lead engagement) would be most valuable for their specific business model.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often should technology stacks be evaluated?</summary>

Technology should be evaluated regularly as business needs evolve and new solutions become available. Annual reviews are recommended, with more frequent assessments for rapidly growing businesses or when experiencing performance issues. The Snapshot Report provides a baseline for tracking technology improvements over time.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I customize which technology categories are analyzed?</summary>

Yes, you can customize the technology section through the Snapshot Report configuration settings. You can enable or disable the entire technology section, and in some cases, focus on specific types of technology analysis based on your client's industry and needs.
