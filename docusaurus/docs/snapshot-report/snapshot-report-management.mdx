# Snapshot Report Management and Billing

## What is Snapshot Report Management?

Snapshot Report management encompasses all activities related to maintaining, updating, and utilizing your reports effectively. This includes refreshing outdated reports, exporting reports as PDFs, understanding billing structures, and integrating packages to maximize client engagement.

## Why is Management and Billing important?

- **Report Accuracy**: Proper management ensures prospects receive current, accurate data
- **Cost Control**: Understanding billing helps manage expenses and plan budgets
- **Client Engagement**: Effective management enhances prospect experience and conversion rates
- **Business Growth**: Proper utilization of reports can increase close rates and revenue
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined management processes save time and reduce errors

## What's Included with Report Refresh Management?

### When to Refresh Reports

Snapshot Reports are active and accurate for **seven days** after creation. After this period, the report stops updating and requires refreshing to provide current data. Common refresh scenarios include:

- **Extended Sales Cycles**: When you need more time to close a deal
- **Rekindling Prospects**: Providing updated data to re-engage old prospects  
- **Significant Changes**: When the business has made major website or online presence updates
- **Competitive Analysis**: When you want the most current competitive comparison data

### Refresh Methods

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts**
2. Open the Snapshot scorecard by clicking the **Snapshot icon** next to the account name

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Why am I charged for refreshing Snapshot Reports?</summary>

Snapshot Reports are prospecting tools typically generated once during the prospecting phase. Creating and refreshing are separate products, both charging $2. Some subscription tiers include 'free' reports that can only be used for creating new reports, not refreshing existing ones, as refreshing is treated as a separate product.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does a Snapshot Report take to be ready and when is best to present it?</summary>

Wait a minimum of 24 hours before viewing reports. The system scans the internet for business information and matches it across directories, which takes time to avoid being identified as malicious software. Reports continue gathering data for up to 7 days, with the most accurate presentation time being at the 7-day mark.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get notifications when Snapshot Reports are ready?</summary>

Yes, when prospects request reports via the Acquisition Widget, the assigned salesperson receives email notifications. For manually created reports, you can check report status in the Partner Center or set up reminders to check reports after the recommended 24-hour waiting period.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I refresh a report multiple times?</summary>

Each refresh generates a completely new report and incurs the standard $2 fee. The new report replaces the previous version entirely—previous data is not preserved. Multiple refreshes in short periods are not recommended as data may not change significantly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I recover old report data after refreshing?</summary>

No, refreshing completely replaces the old report with new data. If you need to preserve historical data, save the report as a PDF before refreshing, or maintain separate records of key metrics for comparison purposes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I know if someone requested a Snapshot Report via the Acquisition Widget?</summary>

Immediately after a customer requests a report via the Acquisition Widget, an account is created in the platform, the assigned salesperson gets the prospect, and they receive an email notification. You can also monitor new accounts in the Partner Center for widget-generated leads.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I set up automatic report refreshing?</summary>

While reports don't automatically refresh on their own, you can use email campaigns with Snapshot Creation Events to automatically refresh reports older than 30 days when sending campaigns. This provides a semi-automated approach to keeping prospect data current.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between creating and refreshing in terms of data?</summary>

Creating a report generates entirely new data analysis for a business. Refreshing updates existing report data with current information. Both processes involve the same comprehensive analysis and data collection, which is why they cost the same amount.
