# Snapshot Report Sections – Website Performance and SEO

## What are Website Performance and SEO?

Website Performance and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) are critical factors that determine how well a business's website functions and ranks in search engines. The Snapshot Report uses Google's Core Web Vitals and comprehensive SEO analysis to evaluate these essential digital marketing components.

## Why are Website Performance and SEO important?

### Website Performance Impact
- **User Experience**: Fast, responsive websites create enjoyable experiences that build stronger brand recognition
- **Conversion Rates**: Smooth page experiences can lead to increased online sales, especially for ecommerce websites
- **Search Rankings**: Page experience metrics are important factors in Search Engine Optimization strategies
- **Customer Retention**: Without good website performance, businesses may not rank high in search engines, impacting their ability to be found by prospective customers

### SEO Impact
- **Organic Visibility**: Proper SEO helps businesses appear in search results when potential customers look for their services
- **Cost-Effective Marketing**: Organic search traffic provides long-term, sustainable customer acquisition
- **Local Discovery**: Local SEO helps businesses be found by customers in their geographic area
- **Competitive Advantage**: Better SEO performance helps businesses outrank competitors

## What's Included with Website Performance Assessment?

### Core Web Vitals Analysis

The Snapshot Report uses Google's Core Web Vitals to evaluate website performance, focusing on three key areas:

#### 1. **Speed (Page Loading)**
- **Page Speed**: Measures how quickly content is visually displayed during page load
- **Large Content Loading**: Measures how long it takes for the largest element within view to load for site visitors

#### 2. **Responsiveness (Interactivity)**
- **Interactivity**: Measures how long it takes the website to respond after a user engages with an on-site element

#### 3. **Visual Stability**
- **Visual Stability**: Measures unexpected shifts in website layout, which can be caused by site elements loading out of sync

### Device-Specific Performance

#### Mobile Performance
Google's PageSpeed Insights scores both speed and UX (user experience) scores for mobile devices. The system combines these scores and compares them to industry percentiles to determine the Mobile grade.

#### Desktop Performance
For desktop scoring, the system takes Google PageSpeed Insights score (out of 100) and compares it to industry percentiles for that business category.

### Homepage Content Analysis

The system evaluates whether key business information is found on the website's homepage, including:

- **Address on homepage**: Physical location information
- **Phone number on homepage**: Contact information accessibility
- **Homepage size**: Overall page size optimization
- **Video on homepage**: Multimedia content presence
- **Social media links**: Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram presence

### Detailed Performance Metrics

The Snapshot Report assesses 10 speed metrics in total:

#### Critical Performance Factors
- **Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS**: When external stylesheets delay first render
- **Leverage browser caching**: When responses lack caching headers or specify short cache times
- **Optimize images**: When images can be optimized to reduce file size without quality loss
- **Enable compression**: When compressible resources aren't served with gzip compression

#### Technical Optimization
- **Minify HTML**: When HTML size could be reduced through minification
- **Minify CSS**: When CSS could be reduced through minification
- **Minify JavaScript**: When JavaScript could be reduced through minification
- **Reduce server response time**: When server response time exceeds 200ms
- **Avoid landing page redirects**: When multiple redirects exist from URL to final page
- **Prioritize visible content**: When additional network requests are required for above-the-fold content

### Performance Report Categories

The detailed report categorizes improvements into three levels:

- **Should Fix**: Rules that failed PageSpeed Insights' tests (immediate priority)
- **Consider Fixing**: Rules that passed tests but could use improvement (optimization opportunities)
- **Passed Rules**: Rules that passed PageSpeed Insights' tests (performing well)

:::note
PageSpeed scores can vary as they are estimates of website performance, not exact numbers. Many factors can influence performance including internet traffic, types of ads being served, device type, and antivirus software.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Why does the SEO score seem inaccurate for my business?</summary>

SEO scores are based on industry percentiles and multiple factors including keyword usage, meta data, content, architecture, links, social presence, and trust signals. The score reflects how the business compares to others in their industry, not absolute performance. Factors like recent website changes, new content, or evolving competition can affect scores.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where does the Snapshot Report find organic SEO keywords?</summary>

The platform automatically scans the prospect's website content and business information to identify the top keywords in the database. The system analyzes website content, business category, and location to determine the most relevant keywords for that specific business.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often do website performance scores change?</summary>

Website performance scores can vary because they are estimates based on real-time analysis. Factors that influence scores include internet traffic, types of ads being served, device types, antivirus software, and server performance. Regular monitoring helps track trends rather than focusing on individual score variations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I see the full website performance report?</summary>

Yes, within the website section below the Core Web Vitals metrics, you'll find separate detailed reports for both mobile and desktop. Click the arrow on the far right of each bar to expand the report and see specific rules that pass or require fixing. You can dive deeper into each rule by clicking the + next to each item.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why might a website rank well locally but poorly in the Snapshot Report?</summary>

The Snapshot Report analyzes SEO performance at the national level. A business may rank well for local searches but not appear in national results for broader keywords. This is common for location-based businesses and doesn't necessarily indicate poor SEO performance in their target market.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do if Core Web Vitals scores are poor?</summary>

Focus on the "Should Fix" recommendations first, which typically include optimizing images, enabling compression, fixing render-blocking resources, and improving server response times. These technical improvements often provide the most significant performance gains.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I improve local SEO rankings?</summary>

Improve local SEO by ensuring Google Business Profile is complete and verified, using location-specific keywords in content, getting listed in local directories, encouraging customer reviews, and ensuring NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across all online listings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can website performance affect SEO rankings?</summary>

Yes, Google uses Core Web Vitals and page experience as ranking factors. Websites with better performance metrics (faster loading, good user experience, mobile-friendliness) can rank higher in search results, making website performance optimization essential for SEO success.
