# Snapshot Report Sections – Social Media and Advertising

## What are Social Media and Advertising Assessments?

The Social Media and Advertising sections of the Snapshot Report analyze two critical components of digital marketing. Social media assessment evaluates presence and engagement across major platforms, while advertising analysis examines online advertising visibility and keyword performance.

## Why are Social Media and Advertising important?

## What's Included with Social Media Assessment?

### Platforms Analyzed

The Snapshot Report evaluates social media presence across major platforms:

#### Facebook Analysis
- **Page Likes/Followers**: Total audience size
- **Posting Frequency**: Average posts per month
- **Engagement Levels**: Interaction rates with content
- **Profile Completeness**: Whether business information is complete

#### Instagram Assessment
- **Follower Count**: Total Instagram following

#### X (Twitter) Evaluation
- **Follower Numbers**: Twitter audience size
- **Tweet Frequency**: Regular posting activity
- **Engagement Rates**: Interaction with tweets
- **Profile Optimization**: Complete business profile information

### Social Media Grade Calculation

Social media grades are calculated by evaluating each platform separately, then combining the results:

1. **Individual Platform Scoring**: Each platform receives grades for subsections (likes, posts/month, engagement)
2. **Platform Grade Calculation**: Subsection grades are converted to numerical values and averaged
3. **Overall Social Grade**: Platform grades are combined and averaged for final social score

#### Example Calculation:
- Facebook: C, C, C, F = (2+2+2+0) ÷ 4 = 1.5 = **D**
- X (Twitter): Not found = **F**  
- Instagram: B, B = (3+3) ÷ 2 = 3 = **B**
- Overall: (1+0+3) ÷ 3 = 1.3 = **D** grade overall

## What's Included with Advertising Assessment?

### Keyword Analysis

The Advertising section analyzes online advertising presence using sophisticated keyword research:

#### Top Keywords Identification
- **Content Analysis**: System identifies top 5 keywords based on website content and business information
- **Industry Relevance**: Keywords selected based on business category and location
- **Competition Assessment**: Analysis of how these keywords perform in the market

#### Search Results Analysis
- **Top 8 Ad Results**: Analyzes first 10 search results focusing on top 8 advertising positions
- **Keyword Performance**: Compares prospect's website against top advertising results
- **Visibility Assessment**: Determines if business appears in top advertising positions

### Advertising Performance Metrics

The system evaluates advertising effectiveness through:

#### National-Level Analysis
- **Keyword Rankings**: Position in national search results for top keywords
- **Competition Analysis**: How business compares to competitors in advertising space
- **Visibility Score**: Overall advertising presence for identified keywords

#### Cost and Value Estimates
- **Estimated Cost Per Click**: Calculated as estimated monthly ad budget ÷ estimated monthly paid clicks
- **Market Competition**: Analysis of advertising competition for key industry terms

:::note
**Important**: Advertising data is gathered at the national level. If a business shows engagement from local advertising but receives an F grade, they're likely ranking at the local level, which the system cannot track due to limitations in analyzing localized results.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>What keywords does the Advertising section use?</summary>

The Advertising section identifies the top 5 keywords for a business based on content gathered from their website and business information. These keywords are selected by analyzing website content, business category, and location to determine the most relevant terms for that specific business.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why don't the keywords match what the prospect is currently running?</summary>
