If a package is not using the new package pricing model based on the retail prices of the individual products contained in the package, it cannot be added to an invoice.

Partners can update their packages to use the new pricing model at any time.

**Note:** Packages using the old pricing model also cannot be purchased through the Shopping Cart.
