*The Recurring Invoice functionality has been discontinued for new Partners. Please familiarize yourself with the enhanced [Subscription Billing](/commerce/commerce-invoices/subscription-billing) feature, which has been introduced as a replacement.*

Templates can not only ease your workload but also make you feel less stressed and at the same increase your efficiency. It helps to save time and money while improving consistency.

A recurring invoice template can be used to repeatedly invoice a customer for products or services they have bought that have a monthly renewal and can be automatically invoiced every month.

The processes will run continuously according to your set schedule in the template.
