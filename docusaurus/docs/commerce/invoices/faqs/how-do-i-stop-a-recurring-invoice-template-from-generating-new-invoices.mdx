*The Recurring Invoice functionality has been discontinued for new Partners. Please familiarize yourself with the enhanced [Subscription Billing](/commerce/subscription-billing) feature, which has been introduced as a replacement.*

You can deactivate a recurring invoice template and stop it from generating invoices, without actually deleting the template.

1. Go to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts > Select account > Invoices > Recurring Invoices**, then select the recurring invoice template you like to stop.

2. On the right-hand panel, you will see an '**Active'** toggle; turn it off and this action will stop more invoices from generating.

3. Click 'Save.'
