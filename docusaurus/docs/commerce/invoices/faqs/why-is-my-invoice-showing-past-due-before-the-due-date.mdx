description: Understanding the timing of the 'past due' status on invoices

The **due date** is determined by the phrase "It has to be paid before X date" and not including the present day. 

For example, if the due date for an invoice is August 9th, once the date is technically beyond 12:00 AM on August 9th, the badge will show up as 'past due' as it had to be paid before August 9th.
