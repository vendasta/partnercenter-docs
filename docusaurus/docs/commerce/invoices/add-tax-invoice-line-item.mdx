Several Digital Marketing and Digital Goods Laws have changed since January 2022, and many items need to be taxed or don't need to be taxed moving forward.

With our [invoicing platform](/commerce/commerce-invoices/invoicing-platform), you can selectively levy tax on an invoice line item or an entire invoice.

**To get started with adding tax to invoices:**

- Open the [Invoice Builder](/commerce/commerce-invoices/invoicing-platform#creating-an-invoice) by navigating to **Partner Center > Commerce > Invoices.**
- Add an Item or a Package if the invoice is blank.
- Click on the Kebab Menu for more options on a line item.
