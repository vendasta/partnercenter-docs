# Billing Disputes

If a customer disputes a charge on their credit card statement, you'll be notified via a charge dispute action in the Merchant Portal. Taking care of the dispute is part of the responsibilities that come along with offering credit card payments.

This guide will show you how to navigate charge disputes, respond to them, and provide evidence to support your case.

## Finding disputes

Disputes can be reviewed in your Merchant Portal by navigating to **Disputes** in the left-hand menu.
