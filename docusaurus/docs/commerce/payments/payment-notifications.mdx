Partners using Vendasta Payments can be notified in-platform when one of their clients pays an invoice or makes a purchase via the Shopping Cart. If a payment fails, Partners will receive a notification via email. Note that only Partner Center admins can receive these notifications.

Invoice and payment notifications can be set up or changed using the **Notification Settings** page in Partner Center.

Under the **Retail Payments** setting, check the "App" notification under the "Platform Settings" column to be notified when a client pays an invoice or makes a purchase via the Shopping Cart.

Partners can also be notified when an invoice is automatically generated by enabling notifications for **Invoice Auto-generated**.
