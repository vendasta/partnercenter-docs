# Where do orders go after submitting for approval?

Based on Partner configuration the order can be sent to one of two places:

## Submitting for Customer Approval

You will be prompted to choose a contact that the order will be sent to - Once this has been sent, it will be delivered to your selected contact. The delivery can be tracked in the Order Activity card.

You may resend the order to a new or the same contact by selecting "Resubmit for Customer Approval" button on the top left of the order.

## Submitting for Admin Approval

When you are submitting for Admin approval the order will enter a "Pending" Status.

It is now up to an administrator with "Can Manage Orders" permissions to review it and either Approve or Decline the order.
