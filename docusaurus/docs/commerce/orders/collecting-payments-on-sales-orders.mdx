# Collecting Payments on Sales Orders in Partner Center

Partner Center offers enhanced capabilities for managing sales orders. Sales orders sent for customer approval can optionally include the ability to add a credit card to collect payment, streamlining the transaction process.

Additionally, orders sent to customers for approval now include a signature input where the customer can type their signature before approving the order. This ensures a smoother and more secure transaction process.

Partner Center Admins will always have the ability to send orders for customer approval, and choose to collect payment

## Enabling the Features for Salespeople

Partner Center admins can follow these steps to configure these features for their Salespeople:

1. Navigate to Administration:
   - Go to **Administration > Customize > Sales > Configure sales orders and processes.**

2. Configure Sales Orders:
   - Find the Salesperson submit actions card.

3. Enable Customer Approval and Payment:
   - Ensure that "Allow salespeople to send an order to customers for approval" is checked.
   - Check the box for "Orders sent for approval by salespeople can accept payment."

Once these steps are completed, Salespeople can select **Submit for customer approval** on an order, and it will be sent to the customer to approve and pay.

Once the customer has approved and a successful payment has been collected, an invoice with a 'Paid' status will be generated as a record of the transaction and the Order will be processed and change to an 'Activated' status

These features enhance the efficiency and security of the sales order process, making it easier for customers to approve and pay for their orders seamlessly.
