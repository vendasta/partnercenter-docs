# Managing orders

Partner Center admins are able to either approve or decline orders.

## Approving Orders

1. From **Partner Center > Commerce > Orders**, click the **Order ID**.
2. Review the order to ensure accuracy, particularly the following: 
   - Any *warnings* at the top of the page, such as orders that contain products already activated.
   - The retail *pricing*, you will be able to see if any pricing has been changed as it will be indicated by listing "Original Price" under pricing input box.
     - All price increases will only be visible to admins 
     - All price decreases will show as a strike through and discount for anyone viewing the order (sales and customer) 
3. Click **Approve** at the bottom of the screen.
4. Click **Approve & Continue**.

After approving the order, the salesperson will receive an email confirmation.

Note that if you are ordering a product that includes a variable wholesale amount (Digital Ads: Campaign for example), you will see an additional card underneath the Order Details card for Wholesale Cost. Make sure to adjust this wholesale cost to the intended value before approving and activating your order.
