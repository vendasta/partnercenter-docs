# Order Statuses

There are a number of statuses that can be applied to orders. We recommend familiarizing yourself and your team with these statuses so that you can assist your teams and customers as quickly and efficiently as possible.

**Orders can be accessed via:**

- Partner Center > Commerce > Orders 
- Partner Center > Accounts > Account Details > Orders Card
- Partner Center > Companies > Company Details > Orders Card

| **Status** | **What it means** | **Notes** |
|------------|-------------------|------------|
| Drafted | The order has been created but not submitted. | Drafted orders can be archived by both Salespeople and Admins. |
| Awaiting customer approval | The order was sent to the customer to approve or decline. | Orders in this status cannot be altered. If there is an error they can be cancelled or archived and then duplicated to edit the details and resend. |
| Pending | The order has been submitted to an admin to approve or decline. | Pending orders will require action from an Administrator to move them to the next step. |
| Approved | The order was approved by the customer or admin. | This is an intermediary that can be used in the ordering process to do actions such as collect payment, prior to activating the order and products. |
| Processing | The products in the order are being activated. | This status generally only appears for a few moments. |
| Scheduled activation | The order was approved, and it is set to activate the associated products on a future date. | You may wish to schedule activation for a later date, products will not be activated until the order has been activated. |
| Activated | All products in the order were activated. | The products and services have been activated. |
| Activation errors | Some products weren't able to be activated and action may be needed. | Activation errors can occur for a number of reasons - you will see the error by hovering over the "Activation Error" badge in the order. Additional information may be available in via the Account Details page. When an order is in this state action will likely be needed to correctly activate the products. You can select "Ignore Errors" once it has been corrected and the order will go into an "Activated" status. |
| Declined | The customer or admin has declined the order. | The customer or admin will be prompted to provide a reason for why the order was declined. |
| Archived | The order is no longer being acted on and is strictly kept for historical purposes. | These orders are only visible by filtering them and are not visible in Business App. Archiving an order is useful for keeping your order table focused on the orders that need your attention. Once an order has been put into Archived, it cannot be undone. |
| Cancellation request | A Salesperson or Admin has requested the order be canceled. | The person who requests cancellation will be prompted to enter a reason. If the cancellation is declined the order will go back to it's previous status. |
| Canceled | The order has been canceled. | This status can be helpful when tracking things like churn. It is important to note that cancelling an order *does not* cancel retail or wholesale subscriptions. |
| Resubmitted | A salesperson has sent a previously rejected order for approval again. | Once a salesperson has addressed the reason given for why the order was declined, they can resubmit the order. |
