# Automations in Business App - Review Requesting

## What are Review Request Automations?

To set up review request automations, follow these steps:

1. From within the Business App, navigate to the **Automations** tab in the left navigation menu.

## Configuring the Automation

The review request automation has several configurable components:

### Enable/Disable

At the top of the automation configuration, you can toggle the automation on or off using the switch. When enabled, the automation will run according to your settings. When disabled, no automated review requests will be sent.

## Best Practices

For optimal results with review request automations:

- **Timing matters**: Send requests 1-3 days after a transaction for best response rates.
- **Personalize content**: Use the customer's name and specific details about their interaction when possible.
- **Keep it simple**: Short, direct emails with clear call-to-action buttons typically perform best.
- **Monitor performance**: Regularly check analytics and adjust your approach based on results.
- **Comply with regulations**: Always ensure your automation practices comply with email and review solicitation regulations in your region.
