The Vendasta App in Zapier allows Partners to connect the Vendasta CRM to several 3rd Party systems using Zapier. Users can select any 3rd Party system available in Zapier as a Trigger which would initiate an action in the Vendasta CRM

### **How Does Triggering and Automation with Zapier Work?**

**Step 1: Selecting the Trigger**

In this step, you can select the trigger that initiates an action in your workflow. As an example when a New Payment in Quickbooks Online can be used as a trigger, however, you can also choose from various other triggers available in Zapier.

**Step 2: Choosing the Action**

After selecting the trigger, you'll need to choose the app that will carry out your desired action. In this scenario, that app would be the Vendasta App. This means that whenever a New Payment is received in Quickbooks online, an automation would be executed in the Vendasta CRM. As part of the Vendasta App in Zapier various actions are possible.

**Step 3: Choosing the Action**

In this step, you'll set the action to be performed when the trigger event happens. For this scenario, the action is to Run Automation in the Vendasta CRM.

Remember, you can change the action anytime by clicking on the dropdown menu and choosing a different option. After selecting the action, click "Continue" to proceed to the next step.

**Step 4: Signing In**

In this step, you'll connect your Vendasta account. Click on "Sign in" to be redirected to the login page. Here, you'll enter your Partner ID or the Account ID of the client you are setting up Zapier for and grant the necessary permissions. After this, you'll be automatically redirected back to Zapier.

**Note:** You only need to complete this process once. In the future, you'll be automatically signed into your account when using the Vendasta Action.

The 'Automation ID' field is a searchable dropdown that lets you find the Automation ID by searching with either the ID or the Automation name. This makes it easier to select the correct automation to run in Vendasta when a trigger occurs in an external system.
