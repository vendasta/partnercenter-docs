If the business's Google Business Profile is connected in Business App, you will see a 'Verified' or 'Unverified' tag.

If the business's Google Business Profile is not connected in Business App, the client will need to log into their Google Business Profile dashboard to see if their profile has been verified.

1. Log into the Google Business Profile Dashboard

2. See if there is a blue check mark or a red shield under the "Your business on Google"

3. If there is a blue check mark, the profile has been verified. If the client sees a red shield, verification still needs to be done.
