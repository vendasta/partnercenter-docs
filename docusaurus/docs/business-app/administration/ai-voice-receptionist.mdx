## What is the AI Voice Receptionist?

The AI Voice Receptionist is a total voicemail replacement, enabling businesses to answer calls 24/7 with an AI-powered receptionist. This feature ensures businesses never miss another call, even outside of business hours. The AI Voice Receptionist can:

- Answer frequently asked questions (FAQs)
- Capture contact details
- Send a detailed call summary to the business for follow-up

Customers no longer need to leave voicemails or face unanswered calls, improving their experience and reducing the chance of them turning to competitors.

## Availability

**Please note that this feature is currently in Open Beta.**

Voice AI is an early and evolving technology. It can perform incredibly well in many scenarios, but also might experience some less than ideal conversations. We are excited to bring big improvements over time as you and your customers experience Voice AI.

This feature is currently available for businesses based in the USA and Canada that have activated Inbox Pro and been assigned a phone number.

## Why Choose the AI Voice Receptionist?

When a business is busy or unavailable, they still want new leads and customers to be taken care of quickly without making them wait.

**Before:**  
A caller reaches out to a business, but if the call isn't answered, it might go to voicemail or simply ring indefinitely. This often leads to customer frustration and missed opportunities, as leads go to the next business that answers the phone.

**Now:**  
With the AI Voice Receptionist, every call receives an answer—24/7. Even if the business cannot respond immediately, the AI voice receptionist:

- Represents the business professionally
- Answers questions
- Captures the caller's request and contact information for follow-up

## How to Set Up and Use the AI Voice Receptionist

1. **Ensure Eligibility:**
   - AI Voice call receptionist is available to users of Inbox Pro in USA or Canada.
   - Ensure an active phone number is assigned to the account. (Note: A2P registration is not required to start using calling features on the assigned phone number.)

2. **Enable the AI Voice Receptionist:**
   - Go to **Business App** > **AI Workforce** > **AI Voice Receptionist** > **Configure**.
   - Check on "Phone call: Answer with Voice AI" and hit save.
   - Test the default Voice Receptionist by calling your assigned number.

3. **Customize the AI Receptionist:**
   - Assign a custom name to the AI.
   - Update business knowledge to ensure accurate database from which it can lookup answers.
   - Add 'additional instructions' for common caller scenarios:
     - Example: IMPORTANT: When you answer the phone, say "Hello...."
     - Example: "If someone asks about reservations, direct them to [website.com]."
     - Example: "If someone inquires about sending a fax, provide... relevant instructions.
   - **Customizing AI Voice Receptionist Options**: There are multiple voices to choose from, divided into different families—each with their own strengths. Businesses can now select from:
     - **Astra**: Multilingual, less expressive, slower speaking
     - **Horizon**: Multilingual, very expressive
     - **Deepgram Aura** (New): English-only, highly accurate speech recognition, slightly robotic tone
   
   The **Deepgram Aura** voice family includes 16 new English-only voices designed for **more reliable and accurate caller understanding**, especially in noisy or difficult audio conditions. While these voices are less expressive than other options, their strength lies in understanding callers clearly and consistently—making them ideal for public-facing businesses that prioritize precision over tone.
   
   > Note: Deepgram is currently English-only and may sound more robotic compared to Astra or Horizon voices, but offers superior speech recognition accuracy.
   
   Each voice family provides different strengths, ensuring businesses can select the tone, accent, and personality that align best with their customer base.

## How to Select a Voice Option:

1. Navigate to **Business App > AI Workforce > AI Voice Receptionist > Configure.**
2. Locate the **Voice Settings** section.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What happens if the AI cannot answer a caller's question?**

If the AI cannot answer a caller's question, it will capture the caller's details and pass the inquiry to the business for follow-up. This ensures no leads or customer concerns are missed.

**2. How accurate is the AI at answering FAQs?**

The AI is trained with the business's knowledge base and FAQs. The open beta preview is highly capable, but you may see unexpected behavior. Accuracy will also depend on how well the business provides up-to-date and comprehensive information during configuration.

**TIP:** Don't give the AI too much knowledge to draw from; it currently performs best when it's been given only highly relevant, specific information that it will need for common phone interactions.

**TIP:** For best performance answering common questions, add instructions to the 'Additional Instructions' area of the Voice AI configuration, since this information is available for the AI to use in its answers without needing to "look up" anything. Common questions like pricing, services, FAQs can be added there.

**3. Can I choose which languages my AI receptionist speaks?**

Yes, businesses can enable specific languages for the AI receptionist based on their audience. Many common languages are supported, and the voice AI can switch into a different language at a caller's request. Multi-language support is currently in beta, so results may vary.

**TIP:** To instruct your AI to answer calls by default in another language, add this to the 'additional instructions': "IMPORTANT: Begin all calls by speaking [language], and say: "Bonjour..."

**4. How do I listen to call recordings and review transcripts?**

Call recordings and transcripts are accessible through the Inbox and the CRM. New calls will appear in Inbox, and be logged on the contact activity in the CRM.
