SSO-Based Integrations with Vendasta offer key features that greatly enhance usability and effectiveness, namely Data Sync and Automated Review Requests. Here's how you can use these features effectively:

## 1. Check Connection Status

- Ensure that Business App has an active connection by clicking on the **Manage** tab on the **Integrations** page and checking for the Jobber connection card. A green tick mark on the connection card indicates an active connection.

- **Note:** Sending out Automated Review Requests requires a Reputation Management Premium subscription. If you do not have this subscription, the option of enabling review requests will be locked in the Connection Settings page. You can unlock this feature by purchasing the Reputation Management Premium subscription.

## 2. Data Sync

- Data from the Vendor System is synced into the Vendasta system upon successful action. Consider, for example, Jobber - on two possible events in Jobber the data is synced into Vendasta, you can choose the appropriate option via the Connection Settings page.
  - A Visit is Completed
  - A Job is Completed

- For example, a customer for whom the business has completed a job or visit, the same event is logged in Jobber. Their details are used to create a new contact in the Business App or update their details if the contact is already present in the Business App.

- This ensures that all relevant customer and transaction information is up-to-date and accessible within Vendasta.
- To enable data sync, ensure that the integration is set up correctly and that the necessary permissions are granted.

## 3. Automated Review Requests

- Upon a successful action in the Vendor System, Vendasta can automatically send review requests to customers.
