The **Invoices** tab in Business App gives your clients the ability to **view**, **download**, and **pay** for invoices if you use **Vendasta Payments**. By clicking on any invoice, they will be able to see the invoice details, enter their credit card information, and make a payment. By clicking the **â‹® (three-dot menu)** in line with their invoice, they can also **view receipts** or **download the invoice**.
