# Track web chat events in Google Analytics using Tag Manager

Integrating Google Tag Manager (GTM) with your web chat can provide valuable insights into user interactions. This guide walks you through the process of tracking chat events using Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this integration, ensure you have:

1. An active Web Chat account
2. Access to Google Tag Manager
3. A configured Google Analytics property

## Setting up event tracking

Follow these steps to set up web chat event tracking:

### 1. Create custom event triggers in Google Tag Manager

Start by creating triggers that will respond to your web chat events:

Create specific triggers for each chat event you want to track:

### 2. Configure Google Analytics event tags

Create new GA4 event tags that will fire when your triggers are activated:

### 5. Publish your changes

Once you've verified everything is working correctly in preview mode, publish your changes to make them live on your website:

## Verifying event tracking

After publishing your changes, you can verify that events are being tracked by:

1. Opening your Google Analytics dashboard
2. Navigating to the Real-Time reports section
3. Interacting with your chat widget on your website
4. Confirming that events appear in your real-time reports

## Available web chat events

The following events can be tracked through this integration:

- **Chat Started**: Triggered when a visitor initiates a chat session
- **Chat Message Sent**: Triggered when a visitor sends a message
- **Chat Message Received**: Triggered when the visitor receives a response
- **Chat Ended**: Triggered when a chat session concludes

## Troubleshooting

If you're not seeing events in Google Analytics:

1. Verify that your GTM container is properly installed on your website
2. Check that your triggers are set up with the correct event names
3. Ensure your Google Analytics configuration is correctly linked in GTM
4. Use the GTM preview mode to debug event firing
