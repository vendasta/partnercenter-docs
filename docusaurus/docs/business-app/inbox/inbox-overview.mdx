The web chat is 100% AI-managed lead capture.

The AI assistant can access "knowledge" from the business profile, so it can answer questions about services, location and contact info, and hours. It can also be trained on the text from a business website. You can also add additional text Q&A 'knowledge' to the AI assistant so it can answer frequently asked questions from any supplied text.

**Q: How do I install the web chat widget?**

The web chat widget can be installed on any website. To install, copy and paste the widget install code into the `<head>` element of your website, typically just before the closing `</head>` tag.
