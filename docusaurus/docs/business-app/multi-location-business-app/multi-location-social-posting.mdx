- Customize posts for each individual location through dynamic content and allow the individual locations to customize multi-location posts in their own Social Marketing app.
- Review and monitor brand performance and drill down on individual locations in one view

## How does it work?

Before you begin, make sure you have Multi-location Business App set up and that each location has Social Marketing Standard or Pro.
