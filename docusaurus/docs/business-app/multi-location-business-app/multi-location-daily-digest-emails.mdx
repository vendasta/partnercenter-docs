# If a user is added to a multi-location group, will they be sent the daily digest emails for each account in the group?

Multi-location groups are to view the aggregated stats, not for getting notifications. Those still come from individual accounts and associated users. So the user would still need to be added to the individual accounts as well to get the daily notifications.
