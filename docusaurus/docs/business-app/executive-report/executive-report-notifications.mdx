By default, the Executive Report email will be sent to **Business App users** under these conditions:

- Users on accounts with **active products** that push data to the report, and
- Users on accounts that have **authenticated Google Business Profile or Advertising Intelligence metrics**.

It is also possible to control email settings at the user level by clicking the three dots next to a user, then selecting "Edit Notifications", Business App, then adjusting the Executive Report notification settings.
