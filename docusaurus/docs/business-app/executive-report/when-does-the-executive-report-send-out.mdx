# When does the Executive Report send out?

The **monthly** Executive Report usually goes out between the 1st - 3rd days of each month. The **weekly** Executive Report is sent out on Mondays.

The Executive Report may be sent outside of business days as it recognizes the start of each month, not specifically Monday-Friday.

Accounts with active products generally trigger Executive Reports to be sent, however, ***for accounts with only Local SEO active, users will not receive any Executive reports if they don't have any changes in data as changes in the data are needed for a new executive report entry.***

***Please note that if there are no changes from the previous month for any specific section of the report, the section will not populate on the report for the current month.***
