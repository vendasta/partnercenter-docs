## What is the Executive Report?

The Executive Report is your client's single source of truth for the state of their online presence. It assembles metrics from products throughout the platform, giving clients a rollup of everything happening across their digital marketing channels week-to-week or month-to-month. This report is white-labeled and automatically generated under your brand, providing clients with a first-hand look at the return on their investment.

## Why is the Executive Report important?

The Executive Report helps you give clients relevant, personalized, actionable data at the right time. It serves as your tool for engaging with clients, continually proving your value, and retaining them for longer. Studies show that using the Executive Report with connected data sources like Google Business Profile can increase client retention rates by 51% over 24 months compared to those who don't use the Executive Report.

By receiving proof-of-performance reporting consistently, you provide clients with evidence of the value you bring to their business and engage them in your Business App offering.
