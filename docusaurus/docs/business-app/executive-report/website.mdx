# Executive Report: Website Performance

## What is Website Performance Reporting?

Information from Website Standard/Pro can be found in the Executive Report! You can see comprehensive website analytics including Google Analytics data on your client's WordPress sites right in the Executive Report. This includes stats on visitors, page views, time on the website, referral sources, and more.

## Why is Website Performance Reporting important?

The Executive Report is a key tool in showing your proof of performance and demonstrating your clients' progress across marketing channels. You can use the Executive Report to show your clients their website performance alongside the other products you offer themâ€”giving them a rollup view of the value you deliver.

Users with a Google Analytics account connected to Business App will find the Executive Report to be even more useful in monitoring their website's performance. They can see improved measurements of their site's traffic, referral sources, bounce rate, and more.

## How Website Performance Reporting Works

### Website Pro Integration
Website performance information will appear in the Executive Report when you activate Website Standard/Pro for an account and connect a WordPress site.
