# Configuring My Products in Business App

The **My Products** page offers a comprehensive list of all of your businesses products for easy accessibility through Business App. From this page, you will see all of the active products on your account, and can easily pin your most used products to the side panel.

### **How does My Products page work?**

1. Log into Business App and click on **My Products.**

### **How can I organize the products on the side panel of Business App?**

By clicking on the **My Products** page and clicking on the **pin icon** in the top right of each product, you can choose which products will appear on the Business App side panel, for yourself. Each user can set these independently.

### **Why can't I pin a product to the navigation panel of Business App?**

![Cannot pin product example](/img/business-app/my-products/cannot-pin-product.jpg)

Products with dashboards can be pinned to the navigation panel in Business App. In the example above, a custom product was not set up with a URL to direct the user when they click on it. If the product does not have an associated link, the product card is only visible as a piece of information and can't be pinned.

Read [this resource](/business-app/custom-products/adding-a-custom-product) to learn how to add a link to your custom product.
