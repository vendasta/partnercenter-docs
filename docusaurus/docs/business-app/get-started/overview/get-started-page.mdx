## What is the Get Started Page?

The **Get Started** page streamlines onboarding for new Business App users, ensuring they can quickly access key features that drive engagement and value.

## How to Access It

The Get Started Page appears in the **Home** tab as a card labeled "Complete Setup" if setup steps are incomplete. Once all steps are complete, the page disappears.
