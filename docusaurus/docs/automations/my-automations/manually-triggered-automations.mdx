# Manually Triggered Automations

Manually triggered automations are a powerful feature that allows you to execute automations on demand, rather than waiting for specific triggers or scheduled times. This guide explains how to set up and use manually triggered automations.

## Creating a Manually Triggered Automation

When creating an automation, you can set it to be manually triggered by selecting the appropriate option:
