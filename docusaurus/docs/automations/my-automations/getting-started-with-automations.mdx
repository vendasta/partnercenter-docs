An automation workflow is simply a set of instructions that tell the platform "***when*** this specific trigger happens, ***then*** perform this action." For example, "When a new client is added, then assign a salesperson to the account."

Here are some ideas of how you can use Automations.

### **Welcome new clients**

When an account is created, automatically send an email campaign to welcome them to the platform. Assign a salesperson to that account, and create a task for the salesperson to connect personally with the client. 

### **Drive product upgrades**

When your clients activate a Standard product, automatically send them an email campaign outlining the benefits of the Pro edition. Set the automation to log your lead's activity in the Sales & Success Center, and notify your team when your customers open or click through an email.

### **Keep track of failed payments** 

When your customer has a failed payment, receive a notification so you can follow up with them quickly.
