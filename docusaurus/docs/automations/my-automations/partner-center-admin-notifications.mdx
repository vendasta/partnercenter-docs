# Partner Center Admin Automation Notifications

**Can I Configure the sender email for Partner Center Admin notifications?**

Currently, there is no option to personalize/customize the email that sends this notification as it is a transactional email and a part of the "general-automation-notification" workflow.

When configuring automations there is an option that allows you to select a step for notifications to be sent to the Partner Center Admin.
