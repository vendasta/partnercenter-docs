# Start a Campaign When a Snapshot Report is Created or Refreshed

## Template Name

Start a Campaign When a Snapshot Report is Created or Refreshed.

## Purpose

This automation streamlines the process of launching campaigns based on Snapshot Reports. When a Snapshot Report is created or refreshed, this automation triggers a pre-defined workflow to initiate an selected campaign efficiently.

## How It Works

**Trigger Event:**

- The automation triggers when a Snapshot Report is either created or refreshed in your system.

**Delay Period:**

- A 25-hour delay is applied after the trigger event. This buffer ensures adequate time for the report preparation process to complete.

**Campaign Launch:**

- After the delay, the workflow initiates a campaign for the associated account.
- The automation uses a pre-selected Snapshot Campaign from your campaign library.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency:** Automates campaign initiation, saving manual effort.
- **Timeliness:** The delay ensures data readiness before campaign launch.
- **Customizability:** Supports selection of tailored campaigns to fit different account needs.

## Use Cases

- **Sales Enablement:** Automatically follow up with a targeted campaign after generating a Snapshot report.

## Ways to customize this template

- Once you've copied the template, you can customize it to suit your needs.
- For example, add a 'Delay until an event happens' step to monitor certain email events like clicks, opens, bounces etc. to either create tasks, add tags, adding the account to a list and much more.
