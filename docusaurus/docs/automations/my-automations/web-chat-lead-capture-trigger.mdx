The Web Chat Lead Trigger activates when a Web Chat summary is generated for a lead, whether it's for a newly created contact via Web Chat or an existing contact. It can output key information such as the contact ID, chat summary, chat link, and more, tailored to your company's needs. This data can be used to create CRM-related tasks, update contact details, and notify stakeholders. Advanced users can even push this data to their own platforms using the 'Send a Webhook' action.
