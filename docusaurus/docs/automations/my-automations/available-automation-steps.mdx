Automation steps are the events that you want to happen whenever your workflow starts (after the trigger event happens). You can add multiple steps to a workflow, but you need at least one. Automations will perform the steps from the top down.

This article goes through the complete list of automation steps that can accompany each trigger. See the full list of triggers [here](/automations/automations-my-automations/available-automations-triggers-list). We have a few video examples of how to configure these steps [here](#walkthroughs).
