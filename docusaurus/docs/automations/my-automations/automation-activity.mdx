# Automation Activity

The Automation Activity tab is where you can find all of the activities for your automations, including errors or other details.

## Error Handling

If an automation encounters an error, you'll see this in the activity tab. Errors show up with an "Error" status and include details about what went wrong.

## Retrying Failed Automations

If an automation fails, you can retry it by clicking the "Retry" button. This will open a modal where you can select which step to retry from:

You can choose to retry from a specific step in the automation:

This allows you to fix issues and continue automations without having to restart them from the beginning.
