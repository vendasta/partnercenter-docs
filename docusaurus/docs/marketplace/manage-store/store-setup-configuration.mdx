# Store Setup & Configuration Guide

Building and customizing your Marketplace store is the foundation of your digital product sales strategy. Your store is the primary interface for customers—proper setup and configuration are critical. This guide covers initial setup through advanced customization.

## Why setup matters

Your customer's shopping experience fundamentally depends on how thoughtfully you configure your store, making setup decisions critical to your business success. A well‑designed store transforms product browsing from a complex task into an intuitive experience that drives results.

**Direct customer purchases** become possible when your store is properly configured, allowing customers to discover, evaluate, and buy packages and products without requiring sales intervention. This self-service capability reduces your operational overhead while giving customers the convenience of purchasing on their own timeline and terms.

**Brand consistency** across all customer touchpoints strengthens your market position and builds trust. When your store seamlessly integrates with your website and other customer-facing materials, you create a cohesive experience that reinforces your professional identity and expertise.

**Revenue growth** naturally follows from optimized store design that increases conversion rates and average order values. Strategic product placement, clear value communication, and streamlined purchasing processes all contribute to better financial performance.

**Scalability** emerges when automated processes reduce administrative overhead as your business grows. Proper initial setup means fewer manual interventions later, allowing you to serve more customers without proportionally increasing your workload.

**Customer satisfaction** improves dramatically when intuitive navigation and clear information help visitors quickly find what they need. Before sharing your store with customers, ensuring all settings are optimized for performance and user experience creates the foundation for positive customer relationships and repeat business.

## Complete store setup workflow

### 1) Product and package foundation

**Discover and enable products** by exploring the comprehensive marketplace catalog to find solutions that align with your customers' specific needs and business challenges. This foundational step determines what you'll be able to offer and directly impacts your revenue potential.

Begin by navigating to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Discover Products** where you can systematically explore the available options. Take time to browse different product categories to understand the full scope of solutions available and identify opportunities you might not have initially considered.

Thoroughly evaluate product details for each potential addition to your portfolio. Review screenshots to understand the user experience your customers will have, examine supporting files and documentation to assess implementation requirements, study detailed feature lists to understand capabilities, and review vendor information to ensure you're comfortable with the partnership.

Enable products strategically by clicking "Start Selling" on solutions that genuinely fit your target market's needs and budget ranges. The system automatically includes all product editions and add-ons, giving your customers complete access to the full product experience without additional setup work.

**Benefits of this approach** include eliminating upfront costs since you only pay when customers actually purchase products, gaining immediate store availability for all enabled products, accessing comprehensive marketing materials and support resources that help you sell effectively, and maintaining flexibility to modify pricing or remove products as market conditions change.

**Multi-market considerations** become important if you operate across different geographic regions. The platform automatically adds enabled products to all configured markets, but you can control specific availability through **Marketplace > Products** settings to tailor offerings for regional preferences or regulatory requirements.

### 2) Product configuration and pricing

Once you've enabled products, fine-tuning their configuration through **Partner Center > Marketplace > Products** ensures each offering is optimized for your specific market and business model.

**Pricing optimization** gives you control over how products are priced and billed in your store. Retail price adjustment allows you to click the lock icon and modify default pricing to better match your market's willingness to pay or to optimize profit margins. You can change billing frequency settings to align with your customers' preferences, though it's important to note that wholesale billing frequency remains unchanged regardless of customer billing cycles. Market-specific pricing becomes valuable when operating across different geographic regions with varying economic conditions or competitive landscapes.

**Advanced configuration options** provide deeper control over product behavior and presentation. Automatic activation settings let you toggle auto-activation for Standard products, reducing manual processing when customers purchase. White-label branding capabilities allow you to customize product names and icons for applicable products, presenting marketplace solutions as your own offerings. Upgrade path configuration enables you to design customer upgrade options for Standard products, creating clear progression paths that increase customer lifetime value. Team access controls determine which internal team members can access products across all customer accounts, ensuring appropriate access levels for support, sales, and administrative functions.

### 3) Custom product integration

**Add your own products**
Expand beyond marketplace offerings by creating custom products:

**Quick Product Creation Process:**

## Store customization and branding

### Visual theme

Your store's visual presentation significantly impacts customer perception and conversion rates. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Manage Store > Theme** to transform the default interface into a branded experience that reflects your business identity.

**Color customization** allows you to control every aspect of your store's visual hierarchy. The logo bar section containing your logo and authentication buttons can be styled to match your brand colors, while background settings let you choose specific colors or transparency options that integrate seamlessly with your website. Accent colors affect button text and category tab indicators, creating visual cues that guide customer navigation. Primary category styling impacts main navigation elements and package names, establishing the dominant visual tone, while secondary category colors influence pricing displays and supplementary information.

**Typography choices** reinforce your brand personality through font selection. Primary fonts control how package names, category names, and main descriptions appear, making this choice crucial for readability and brand consistency. Secondary fonts handle price information and supplementary text, requiring a balance between clarity and visual harmony with your primary font choice.

**Advanced customization options** provide additional flexibility for seamless integration. Transparent background settings remove the default background entirely, allowing your store to blend naturally with your website design. Real-time preview functionality lets you see changes immediately as you make adjustments, enabling rapid iteration and refinement. Maintaining brand consistency throughout all visual choices ensures alignment with your overall brand guidelines and creates a cohesive customer experience.

**Currency Configuration Process:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Manage Store > Currency**

   - Marketplace products include suggested pricing in USD, CAD, and AUD

**Multi-Currency Considerations:**
- Store can only use one currency per market
- Wholesale currency determined by Vendasta contract
- Possible to sell in different currency than billing currency
- Automatic conversion rates available for non-default currencies

**Conversion for other currencies**
For stores using currencies other than USD, CAD, or AUD:
1. Set currency conversion rate during currency selection
