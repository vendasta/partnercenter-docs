# Accepting purchases with the Shopping Cart

You can use the Marketplace Shopping Cart to accept payments from customers directly in the Marketplace stores or enable customers to complete the purchase in a separate external URL. In this article, you'll learn how to configure your Marketplace store to accept purchases from customers.

To get started, navigate to **Marketplace Admin** > **Manage Stores**. Select your store from the list. On the following page, you'll need to configure the settings below before you can successfully accept purchases through your Marketplace store:

## 1. Set up your pricing and currency

Navigate to the **Store Settings** tab. Scroll down to the **Currency Settings** section.

**What currency would you like to display retail pricing in?**

Select the currency that customers will see when viewing pricing in the Marketplace store. Options include dollars, pounds sterling, euros, Australian dollars, and Canadian dollars.

**How would you like to calculate your seller's cost?**

This setting controls how pricing calculations are done for the seller. You have three options:

- **As a percentage of the retail price**: The seller's cost is derived from the retail price
- **As a flat fee**: The seller pays a consistent flat fee
- **Free to the seller**: The seller doesn't pay anything

**Enter the mark-up that you'd like to apply to seller's cost**

If you selected percentage or flat fee above, enter the amount that you'd like to collect on each sale. For percentage, this is the percentage of the retail price you wish to collect as margin. For flat fee, this is the flat amount per subscription you wish to collect.

## 2. Configure retail price settings

Navigate to the **Price Display Settings** section.

**How would you like to show product prices in your marketplace store?**

These options determine how pricing is displayed to the customer:

- **Show total cost at checkout**: Customers will see the pricing when they go to check out
- **Display price and allow for purchase**: Customers will see pricing on product listing pages and be able to purchase
- **Display price, but don't allow for purchase**: Customers can see pricing but cannot complete purchases
- **Contact for pricing**: Customers will see a "Contact for pricing" message instead of the actual price

## 3. Set up customer purchase behavior

Navigate to the **Checkout Settings** section.

**How would you like customers to complete their purchases?**

This setting determines where and how customers complete their purchases:

- **In the Marketplace Store**: Customer purchases are completed entirely within your Marketplace store
- **External site or platform**: Customers are redirected to an external site to complete their purchase

**If your purchase flow contains a redirect to an external site, enter the URL**

If you selected the external option above, enter the URL where customers will be redirected to complete their purchase.

## 4. Save your changes

Once you've configured all the settings above, click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page to save your changes.
