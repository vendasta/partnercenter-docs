# Packages - Overview & Creation

Packaging lets you bundle products and services into value‑based combinations at different price points. Use Packages to design, price, and present complete solutions that appeal to a range of customers and maximize revenue.

## What are packages?

Packages are strategically curated bundles of products and services that work together to solve comprehensive customer needs. Rather than forcing customers to research and select individual products, packages allow you to create complete solutions that provide greater value to customers while significantly increasing your average order value and profit margins.

The package approach transforms how customers perceive and purchase your offerings. When you present products as cohesive solutions rather than individual tools, customers can more easily understand the value proposition and envision how the complete solution will address their business challenges.

**The strategic benefits** of package-based selling include more efficient product distribution since customers purchase multiple products in a single transaction, enhanced branding opportunities that present you as a comprehensive solution provider rather than a simple reseller, substantially higher average order values and profit margins compared to individual product sales, simpler decision-making processes for prospects who can choose complete solutions rather than assembling individual components, and clear upgrade and expansion paths that create natural progression opportunities for customer growth.

## Package types

### Store packages
Store packages provide a comprehensive overview of all packages configured in your Public Store, making them available both through the Business App interface and as embeddable components on your website. This dual availability ensures customers can access your packages through their preferred interaction method.

The store package system includes powerful organizational features that let you filter packages by status to focus on active offerings, organize content by product type or LMI category for logical grouping, maintain live availability updates in customer stores to ensure accurate information, and provide seamless shopping cart integration that enables immediate purchase capability.

### Recommended packages
Recommended packages represent Vendasta's curated selection of bundles specifically designed to deliver maximum value to your customers. These pre-configured packages leverage data from thousands of successful partner relationships to identify product combinations that consistently drive results for local businesses.

The recommended package collection includes proven solutions like Business App Pro for comprehensive business management, Digital Success 2024 packages in Start, Grow, and Accelerate tiers for scalable marketing solutions, specialized Ads packages for businesses focused on advertising performance, and Website packages for companies prioritizing online presence development.

### Custom packages
Custom packages empower partners to create tailored combinations of products and services that align perfectly with their specific market needs and unique customer requirements. This flexibility allows you to respond to market opportunities that may not be addressed by existing marketplace offerings or recommended packages.

## How to use recommended packages

Recommended packages provide an excellent starting point for Partners who want to leverage proven product combinations without starting from scratch.

## Create custom packages

Custom package creation gives you complete control over product combinations, pricing strategies, and customer experience design.

### Workflow

#### Step 1: Initial setup
Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages** and select **Create Package**.

Market selection: if you use Markets, select the target market in the Packages table before creating.

#### Step 2: Naming
**Package Name Configuration:**
- Choose a descriptive name that appears in your Store
- Consider customer language and search terms
- For single-product packages, the product name is used automatically
- Ensure brand consistency across your package portfolio

#### Step 3: Product selection and organization
Adding products
1. Click **+ Add item** to select products for your package
2. Only products you're currently selling appear in the selection list
3. **Organize Contents:** Drag items to reorder them logically
4. **Remove Items:** Click the X icon to remove unwanted products
5. **Product Availability:** Ensure all included products are enabled for sale

Selection strategy
- Group complementary products that solve related problems
- Consider customer workflow and implementation order
- Balance package value with price point accessibility
- Plan for natural upgrade paths to higher-tier packages

#### Step 4: Purchase behavior
Package purchase behavior determines customer interaction with your packages and significantly impacts conversion rates.

Options
- **Add to Shopping Cart** - Standard e-commerce experience with immediate purchase capability
- **Contact Sales** - Launches contact form for sales team interaction
- **External URL** - Redirects to custom landing page or external system

Guidelines
- Use **Shopping Cart** for standardized packages with fixed pricing
- Choose **Contact Sales** for complex solutions requiring consultation
- Select **External URL** for integration with existing sales systems

#### Step 5: Pricing and cost analysis
Overview
The package creation interface provides real-time financial analysis displayed on the right side of the screen.

Retail price management
- **Default Pricing:** Uses Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)
- **Custom Pricing:** Override default with market-optimized pricing
- **Dynamic Updates:** Pricing adjusts automatically as you add/remove products
- **Price Display Options:**
  - **Show as Starting at price** - Indicates variable pricing based on customization
  - **Show Contact Sales instead of price** - Hides specific pricing for consultation-based sales

Setup fees
- Add one-time implementation or setup charges
- Separate recurring costs from initial investment
- Account for onboarding and configuration services

Cost analysis
- **Wholesale Cost:** Your total cost for all package components
- **Profit at Purchase:** Immediate margin calculation (retail price minus wholesale cost)
- **Margin Optimization:** Real-time profit analysis for pricing decisions

Shopping cart compatibility
"Starting at" pricing and "Contact Sales" pricing options make packages incompatible with shopping cart functionality. Use these settings with **Contact Form** purchase behavior for optimal customer experience.

#### Step 6: Marketing materials
Customer‑facing content
Marketing materials appear when customers view packages in your Public Store or Business App Store tab.

Editable elements

Best practices

- Include social proof and credibility indicators

#### Step 7: Publication and availability
**Publishing Options:**
- **Publish** - Makes package immediately available in Public Store and Business App
