# Packages - Overview & Creation

Packaging is the strategic process of designing and creating different combinations of features, functions, and products you can offer customers. Packages in the Marketplace serve as your centralized location to bundle products into compelling combinations—each at different price points—to appeal to a range of different customers and maximize revenue opportunities.

## What Are Packages?

Packages are curated bundles of products and services that work together to solve comprehensive customer needs. Rather than selling individual products, packages allow you to create complete solutions that provide greater value to customers while increasing your average order value and profit margins.

**Key Package Benefits:**
- **Efficient Product Distribution** - Streamlined delivery of multiple solutions
- **Enhanced Branding** - Emphasize your best features and create cohesive offerings
- **Revenue Optimization** - Higher average order values and improved profit margins
- **Customer Acquisition** - Simplified decision-making for prospects
- **Product-Led Growth** - Clear upgrade and expansion paths for existing customers

## Creating Custom Packages

Custom package creation gives you complete control over product combinations, pricing strategies, and customer experience design.

### Package Creation Workflow

#### Step 1: Initial Package Setup
Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages** and select **Create Package**.

**Market Selection:** If using Markets, select the target market for package creation from the Packages table before beginning.

#### Step 2: Package Naming
**Package Name Configuration:**
- Choose a descriptive name that appears in your Store
- Consider customer language and search terms
- For single-product packages, the product name is used automatically
- Ensure brand consistency across your package portfolio

#### Step 3: Product Selection and Organization
**Adding Products:**
1. Click **+ Add item** to select products for your package
2. Only products you're currently selling appear in the selection list
3. **Organize Contents:** Drag items to reorder them logically
4. **Remove Items:** Click the X icon to remove unwanted products
5. **Product Availability:** Ensure all included products are enabled for sale

**Product Selection Strategy:**
- Group complementary products that solve related problems
- Consider customer workflow and implementation order
- Balance package value with price point accessibility
- Plan for natural upgrade paths to higher-tier packages

#### Step 4: Purchase Behavior Configuration
Package purchase behavior determines customer interaction with your packages and significantly impacts conversion rates.

**Purchase Behavior Options:**
- **Add to Shopping Cart** - Standard e-commerce experience with immediate purchase capability
- **Contact Sales** - Launches contact form for sales team interaction
- **External URL** - Redirects to custom landing page or external system

**Behavior Selection Guidelines:**
- Use **Shopping Cart** for standardized packages with fixed pricing
- Choose **Contact Sales** for complex solutions requiring consultation
- Select **External URL** for integration with existing sales systems

#### Step 5: Pricing and Cost Analysis
**Comprehensive Pricing Overview:**
The package creation interface provides real-time financial analysis displayed on the right side of the screen.

**Retail Price Management:**
- **Default Pricing:** Uses Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)
- **Custom Pricing:** Override default with market-optimized pricing
- **Dynamic Updates:** Pricing adjusts automatically as you add/remove products
- **Price Display Options:**
  - **Show as Starting at price** - Indicates variable pricing based on customization
  - **Show Contact Sales instead of price** - Hides specific pricing for consultation-based sales

**Setup Fee Configuration:**
- Add one-time implementation or setup charges
- Separate recurring costs from initial investment
- Account for onboarding and configuration services

**Cost Analysis:**
- **Wholesale Cost:** Your total cost for all package components
- **Profit at Purchase:** Immediate margin calculation (retail price minus wholesale cost)
- **Margin Optimization:** Real-time profit analysis for pricing decisions

**Shopping Cart Compatibility:**
"Starting at" pricing and "Contact Sales" pricing options make packages incompatible with shopping cart functionality. Use these settings with **Contact Form** purchase behavior for optimal customer experience.

#### Step 6: Marketing Material Development
**Customer-Facing Marketing Content:**
Marketing materials appear when customers view packages in your Public Store or Business App Store tab.

**Editable Marketing Elements:**
- **Package Icon** - Visual identifier for quick recognition

- **Tagline** - Compelling value proposition summary
- **Description** - Detailed explanation of package benefits and included services

**Product Display Options:**
- **Show Product Icons and Names** - Display individual product components
- **Show Product Details** - Include detailed product information
- **Invoice Impact:** When product display is disabled, invoices show only package name and total price rather than individual line items

**Marketing Best Practices:**
- Focus on customer outcomes rather than product features
- Use specific, measurable benefits when possible
- Maintain consistent brand voice and messaging
- Include social proof and credibility indicators

#### Step 7: Publication and Availability
**Publishing Options:**
- **Publish** - Makes package immediately available in Public Store and Business App
- **Save Draft** - Saves progress for future editing without customer visibility
- **Draft Management** - Access drafts anytime from Marketplace > Packages using Draft filter

### Adding Products and Packages to Your Store

**Quick Product Enablement:**
When you start selling a product, you receive prompts to:

### Package Link Accessibility
**Q: Will the direct link to package work if the user has no access to the store?**
A: Yes! Users can purchase packages through direct links because the link leads to the shopping cart in Business App. The purchase workflow doesn't require navigation to the Store tab, making packages accessible even to users without store access.

A: Packages can only be deleted one by one, not collectively. To permanently remove packages:

1. **Archive First:** Navigate to Marketplace > Packages, click the 3 dots next to the package, and select **Archive**
2. **Then Delete:** Access archived packages using filters, then select **Delete**
3. **Restoration Option:** Archived packages can be restored if needed by selecting **Restore** from the 3-dot menu

Creating effective packages requires understanding your customers' needs, strategic thinking about product combinations, and ongoing optimization based on performance data. The Vendasta platform provides all the tools necessary to create compelling packages that drive revenue growth and customer satisfaction.
