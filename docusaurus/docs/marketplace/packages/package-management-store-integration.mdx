# Package Management & Store Integration

Effective package management goes beyond creation to encompass the entire lifecycle of your packages, from ongoing editing and optimization to strategic store organization and customer sharing. This comprehensive guide covers all aspects of managing packages once they're created and ensuring they perform optimally in your store environment.

## Package Lifecycle Management

### Editing Published and Draft Packages

Published and draft packages can be modified at any time to respond to market changes, customer feedback, or business strategy adjustments. Changes to published packages take effect immediately, ensuring your store always reflects current offerings.

**Package Editing Process:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Select the target market (if using Markets feature)
3. Click on the package requiring modification
4. Edit any package element:
   - Package name and description
   - Product contents and quantities
   - Individual product pricing
   - Purchase behavior settings
   - Marketing content and materials
5. **Save Options:**
   - **Save & Publish** - Immediate live updates to customer-facing store
   - **Save as Draft** - Preserve changes without publishing

**Real-Time Impact:**
All published package changes are immediately visible to customers in your Public Store and Business App. This enables rapid response to market opportunities and customer needs.

### Package Status Management

#### Archiving Packages
Archiving removes packages from customer view while preserving them for potential future use. This is ideal for seasonal offerings, discontinued combinations, or packages under revision.

**Archive Process:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Select appropriate Market (if applicable)
3. Locate the target package
4. Click the **three dots menu** in the bottom right corner
5. Select **Archive**

Restoration returns archived packages to active status, making them available for customer purchase.

**Restoration Process:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Access **Filters** menu
3. Select **Archived** filter to view archived packages
4. Locate package for restoration
5. Click **three dots menu** > **Restore**
6. Package immediately returns to active status

#### Permanent Package Deletion
Deletion permanently removes packages from the system. This action cannot be undone and should be used only for packages that will never be needed again.

**Deletion Requirements:**
- Packages must be archived before deletion
- Deletion is permanent and irreversible
- Consider long-term business needs before deletion

**Deletion Process:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
