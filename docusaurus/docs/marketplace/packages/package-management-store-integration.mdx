# Package Management & Store Integration

Effective package management covers the entire lifecycle: editing, optimizing, arranging in store, and sharing with customers. This guide focuses on managing packages post‑creation and ensuring they perform in your store.

## Package lifecycle management

### Edit published and draft packages

The package editing system provides complete flexibility to modify both published and draft packages at any time, allowing you to respond quickly to market changes, incorporate customer feedback, or adjust your business strategy as conditions evolve. Changes to published packages take effect immediately, ensuring your store always reflects your current offerings and market positioning.

**The editing process** begins by navigating to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages** where you can access your complete package portfolio. If you're using the Markets feature for multi-geographic operations, select the target market before proceeding to ensure you're editing the correct regional version of your package.

Click on the package requiring modification to access the comprehensive editing interface. Here you can modify every aspect of the package including the package name and description that customers see, the specific product contents and quantities included in the bundle, individual product pricing within the package, purchase behavior settings that control how customers can buy the package, and all marketing content and materials that support the package sale.

**Save options** provide control over when changes go live. Choose **Save & Publish** for immediate live updates to your customer-facing store when you want changes to be available instantly, or select **Save as Draft** to preserve changes without publishing when you need more time to review or coordinate with other business activities.

**Real-time impact** means all published package changes become immediately visible to customers in both your Public Store and Business App interfaces. This immediate deployment capability enables rapid response to market opportunities, competitive pressures, and evolving customer needs without delays or technical barriers.

### Package status management

#### Archive packages
Package archiving provides a powerful tool for managing your offerings without permanently losing work or data. When you archive a package, it's immediately removed from customer view while preserving all configuration details for potential future use. This approach works particularly well for seasonal offerings that you'll want to reactivate later, discontinued product combinations that may become relevant again, or packages currently under revision that aren't ready for customer access.

**The archiving process** starts by navigating to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages** to access your package management dashboard. If you're operating across multiple markets, select the appropriate market to ensure you're archiving the correct regional version of your package.

Locate the target package within your portfolio, then click the **three dots menu** in the bottom right corner to access package management options. Select **Archive** from the available actions and confirm your archiving decision to complete the process.

**Archiving benefits** include immediate removal from your customer-facing store while preserving all package configuration and settings for future reference, maintaining complete historical performance data that helps you understand past success and challenges, enabling quick restoration if market conditions change or you need to reactivate the package, and keeping archived packages visible in Partner Center using the "Archived" filter for easy management and review.

#### Restore archived packages
Restoration returns archived packages to active status, making them available for customer purchase.

**Restoration process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Access **Filters** menu
3. Select **Archived** filter to view archived packages
4. Locate package for restoration
5. Click **three dots menu** > **Restore**
6. Package immediately returns to active status

#### Permanently delete packages
Deletion permanently removes packages from the system. This action cannot be undone and should be used only for packages that will never be needed again.

**Requirements**
- Packages must be archived before deletion
- Deletion is permanent and irreversible
- Consider long-term business needs before deletion

**Deletion process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Apply **Archived** filter in Filters menu
3. Locate package for deletion
4. Click **three dots menu** > **Delete**
5. Confirm permanent deletion

## Store organization and arrangement

### Strategic package positioning

Just like physical retail stores where product placement dramatically influences customer behavior and sales performance, your digital store's presentation and package positioning significantly impact how customers discover, evaluate, and purchase your offerings. Strategic arrangement of packages helps highlight your most valuable solutions and guides customers through a logical progression of your solution portfolio.

**Positioning principles** should guide your package arrangement decisions. **MVP positioning** focuses on highlighting your best-selling and most strategically significant packages in prominent locations where customers will see them first, ensuring your most successful offerings get maximum visibility and consideration.

**Customer journey optimization** involves arranging packages to support natural purchase progression, starting with entry-level solutions that appeal to first-time buyers and progressing to more comprehensive packages that serve customers ready for larger commitments. This approach helps customers find appropriate starting points while creating clear paths for future expansion.

**Visual hierarchy** uses positioning to create clear value distinctions between different package tiers, helping customers understand the relationship between your offerings and making upgrade decisions more intuitive. **Seasonal adaptation** keeps your package arrangement responsive to market conditions and timing, ensuring promotional packages and seasonal solutions receive appropriate visibility when they're most relevant to customer needs.

### Package ordering configuration

**Arrangement process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Switch to **Grid layout** view
3. Click **Edit Order** button
4. **Drag and Drop** packages to desired positions
5. Click **Save Order** to confirm arrangement

**Customer impact**
Package order determines how customers see your offerings in both Business App store and Public Store. Strategic ordering can significantly impact conversion rates and average order values.

### Category management and organization

**Assign categories for visibility**
Proper category assignment ensures packages appear in logical store sections and are discoverable through customer browsing.

**Configuration**
- **Package Categories** - Assign packages to relevant business function categories
- **Store Categories** - Control which categories appear in customer-facing store
- **Market Categories** - Customize category visibility by geographic market
