# Package Management & Store Integration

Effective package management covers the entire lifecycle: editing, optimizing, arranging in store, and sharing with customers. This guide focuses on managing packages post‑creation and ensuring they perform in your store.

## Package lifecycle management

### Edit published and draft packages

Published and draft packages can be modified at any time to respond to market changes, customer feedback, or business strategy adjustments. Changes to published packages take effect immediately, ensuring your store always reflects current offerings.

**Editing process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Select the target market (if using Markets feature)
3. Click on the package requiring modification
4. Edit any package element:
   - Package name and description
   - Product contents and quantities
   - Individual product pricing
   - Purchase behavior settings
   - Marketing content and materials
5. **Save Options:**
   - **Save & Publish** - Immediate live updates to customer-facing store
   - **Save as Draft** - Preserve changes without publishing

**Real‑time impact**
All published package changes are immediately visible to customers in your Public Store and Business App. This enables rapid response to market opportunities and customer needs.

### Package status management

#### Archive packages
Archiving removes packages from customer view while preserving them for potential future use. This is ideal for seasonal offerings, discontinued combinations, or packages under revision.

**Archive process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Select appropriate Market (if applicable)
3. Locate the target package
4. Click the **three dots menu** in the bottom right corner
5. Select **Archive**
6. Confirm archiving decision

**Benefits**

- Preserves all package configuration and settings
- Maintains historical performance data
- Enables quick restoration if needed
- Visible in Partner Center using "Archived" filter

#### Restore archived packages
Restoration returns archived packages to active status, making them available for customer purchase.

**Restoration process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**
2. Access **Filters** menu
3. Select **Archived** filter to view archived packages
4. Locate package for restoration
5. Click **three dots menu** > **Restore**
6. Package immediately returns to active status

#### Permanently delete packages
Deletion permanently removes packages from the system. This action cannot be undone and should be used only for packages that will never be needed again.

**Requirements**
- Packages must be archived before deletion
- Deletion is permanent and irreversible
- Consider long-term business needs before deletion

**Deletion process**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**

## Store organization and arrangement

### Strategic package positioning

Just like physical retail stores, digital store presentation and product positioning significantly impact sales performance. Strategic arrangement of packages helps highlight your most valuable offerings and guides customers through your solution portfolio.

**Principles**
- **MVP Positioning** - Highlight best-selling and most significant packages prominently

**Arrangement process**

2. Switch to **Grid layout** view
3. Click **Edit Order** button
4. **Drag and Drop** packages to desired positions
5. Click **Save Order** to confirm arrangement

**Customer impact**
Package order determines how customers see your offerings in both Business App store and Public Store. Strategic ordering can significantly impact conversion rates and average order values.

### Category management and organization

**Assign categories for visibility**
Proper category assignment ensures packages appear in logical store sections and are discoverable through customer browsing.

**Configuration**
- **Package Categories** - Assign packages to relevant business function categories
- **Store Categories** - Control which categories appear in customer-facing store
- **Market Categories** - Customize category visibility by geographic market
