# Create a Package of Products

Your customers can only purchase a package through the Shopping Cart from your store if the package has been created first.

## 1. Create a New Package

Go to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Packages**, and select the Create Package button. If you use Markets, you can select which market to create a package in from the Packages table first.

## 2. Package Name

This is the name that the package will have in your Store. If your package only contains one product, it will automatically use the name of that product.

## 3. Add items to a Package

Click + Add item to add an item to your package. Rearrange items by dragging them, or remove items from the package by clicking the X icon. Only products you're selling will appear in this list.

## 4. Package Purchase behavior

A package's purchase behavior changes the action of the Buy button in your Store.

- Select **Add to Shopping Cart** to add the package to a customer's Shopping Cart when they
- click **Get it Now**
- Select **Contact Sales** to launch a contact form when customers click **Get it Now**
- Select **External URL** to redirect your customer to a Specific URL when they click **Get it Now**

## 5. Review Total Wholesale Cost and Retail Price for the Package

Your package's total Retail Price, Profit, and Wholesale Cost are shown on the right side of the screen.

- The package's **Retail Price** is the price that customers will see when viewing the package on your Public Store or under the Store tab in Business App. This total will update automatically as you add or remove items from the package until you edit it. The default retail price is the Vendor's Suggested Retail Price.
  - Select **Show as Starting at price** to indicate that the retail price of the package may change based on certain factors.
  - Select **Show Contact Sales instead of price** to hide the total price of the package.
  - We recommend using either of these settings with the Purchase behavior set to the **Contact Form** option, as these settings make a package incompatible with the Shopping Cart.
- Add a **Setup fee** to products if applicable. This is a one-time fee added to the package price.
- The package's **Wholesale cost** is the total cost you pay when you activate all of the products in the package.
- The package's **Profit at Purchase** is the difference between the retail price you set and the wholesale cost you pay to activate the items in the package.

## 6. Edit Package Marketing Information

Customers see your package's marketing material when they view the package on your Public Store or under the Store tab in Business App. Click on any of the following fields to begin editing:

- Package icon
- Banner image
- Tagline
- Description

Depending on how you want to market a package, you can choose to **show product icons and names** and **show product details** options.

When the Show product icons and names setting is off, invoices created including the package will not show the products contained in the package as line itemsâ€”only the package name and the total price of the package will be displayed.

## 7. Publish a package

Once you've finished creating your package, click Publish to make the package visible to customers in your Public Store and under the Store tab in Business App.

To save a draft of your package to keep working on later, click Save Draft. Draft packages can be viewed in Marketplace > Packages using the Draft filter. Draft packages are not visible to customers when they view your Store.
