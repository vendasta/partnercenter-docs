This guide helps troubleshoot issues with not being able to see packages in the Business App store.

**Common Causes:** Common reasons to explain why published packages are not visible in the Business App store is failing to select a category when the package was created, not selecting which categories appear in your store, and copying your package to the correct market.

### **Troubleshooting Methods**

**Method #1: Failed to Select a Category**

1. Navigate to **Marketplace > Packages**, and search for the package that you created
2. Click on the 3 dots (options menu), and select Change Categories
3. Once you select any of the store categories listed, the package will appear in the Business App Store tab under the selected category.
