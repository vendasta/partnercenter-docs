# Discover Products - Complete Guide

Discover Products is the hub for finding, evaluating, and enabling products that fit your clients' needs and budgets. Browse 250+ curated solutions, compare pricing and profitability, and start selling with a single click.

### At a glance
The Discover Products section transforms product research from a time-consuming task into a streamlined process. You can quickly find and compare products using sophisticated filters and search capabilities, making it easy to identify solutions that align with your customers' needs and your business objectives.

The transparent pricing display shows both wholesale costs and suggested retail prices across different subscription tiers, allowing you to immediately evaluate potential profit margins before making any commitments. When you find a product that interests you, detailed marketing pages provide all the information you need to make an informed decision, and you can start selling with a single click.

## What you can do

The Discover Products interface empowers you to make informed decisions about expanding your product portfolio through three core capabilities.

**Discover and compare** products using the platform's comprehensive filtering and search functionality. You can compare pricing structures and subscription plans across multiple products, examine wholesale costs versus suggested retail prices to understand profit potential, and explore curated collections of top-performing, newly released, and trending products that other successful partners are leveraging.

**Evaluate** products thoroughly by accessing detailed marketing pages that contain everything you need to make informed decisions. These pages include comprehensive feature lists and benefit descriptions, visual screenshots that show the actual product interface, supporting files such as case studies and documentation, frequently asked questions that address common concerns, complete vendor contact details for direct communication, detailed edition comparisons, and country-specific availability information.

**Enable instantly** by clicking the Start Selling button, which immediately adds products to your store at the suggested retail price. The system automatically includes all available editions and add-ons, converts pricing to your store's configured currency, and if you're using the Markets feature, makes the product available across all your geographic markets simultaneously.

## How to Use Discover Products

### Getting started

Your journey begins by navigating to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Discover Products**, where you'll land on the comprehensive All page. This central hub displays every available product and add-on with essential information including product names, detailed descriptions, wholesale costs that you can compare across different subscription tiers using the dropdown selector, and suggested retail prices that help you quickly assess profit potential.

### Explore Featured
The Featured section provides a curated experience by switching your view to **Featured**, where Vendasta's team has organized products into collections of top-performing solutions, newly released offerings, trending products gaining momentum in the market, proven best-sellers, and seasonal recommendations that align with current market demands. This curation saves you time by highlighting products that have demonstrated success with other partners.

### Advanced filters and search

**Category filtering** enables you to narrow your focus by first selecting a broad category that matches your target market's needs, then refining your selection with more specific subcategories. This hierarchical approach lets you explore products by business function such as marketing or customer management, or by industry verticals like restaurants or healthcare.

**Additional filter options** provide even more precision in your product discovery. You can filter by country to see only products available in your target geographic regions, narrow by pricing strategy to focus on subscription-based, one-time payment, or freemium models, specify billing frequency preferences for monthly, yearly, or custom billing cycles, and limit results to specific vendors when you want to work with particular providers you already know and trust.

**Product suggestion capability** ensures that even if a category doesn't currently have products available in your region, you can use the "Suggest a product" feature to request that Vendasta consider adding specific solutions. This feedback helps shape the marketplace's evolution to meet partner needs.

### What's on a product marketing page

Product marketing pages serve as comprehensive resource centers that provide everything you need to evaluate and sell a solution effectively.

**Product information** forms the foundation of each marketing page, presenting detailed features and benefits that help you understand how the solution addresses customer needs. You'll find key selling points that you can use in your own sales conversations, technical requirements that help you assess implementation complexity, integration capabilities that show how the product fits into existing customer workflows, and real-world use cases that demonstrate practical applications.

**Editions and pricing** sections provide complete transparency into the product's commercial structure. You can compare different editions side-by-side to understand feature differences, review pricing across all available tiers to identify the right fit for different customer segments, and explore upgrade and downgrade paths that help you plan customer journey progressions.

**Screenshots and supporting files** give you visual and documentary evidence of the product's capabilities. User interface screenshots help you understand the customer experience, while brochures, case studies, documentation, and video content provide additional resources you can share with prospects or use to educate your sales team.

**Frequently asked questions** anticipate and address common concerns, covering implementation details that help you set proper expectations, billing clarifications that prevent customer confusion, and support and troubleshooting information that builds confidence in the solution.

**Contact information** ensures you can connect directly with vendor teams when needed, including dedicated sales and support contact details, direct email addresses and phone numbers, escalation paths for complex situations, and regional availability information for global vendors.

## Starting to Sell Products

### Quick enablement

The product enablement process has been designed for maximum simplicity and speed, allowing you to expand your offerings without complex setup procedures.

**Single-click activation** transforms product discovery into immediate sales capability. Start by browsing or searching through the Discover Products interface to find solutions that match your market needs. When you find a product you want to offer, simply click the **Start Selling** button to instantly add it to your store. The product immediately becomes available at the suggested retail price with all editions and add-ons automatically included, requiring no additional configuration.

**Automatic system integration** ensures that newly enabled products seamlessly integrate into your existing sales infrastructure. All product editions and add-ons are automatically enabled and available for customer selection. The product immediately appears in the ALL category of your public store, making it discoverable by customers. If you're using the Markets feature for multi-geographic operations, the product is automatically added to all your configured markets, ensuring consistent availability across your entire operation.

### Manage enabled products

Once you've enabled products, ongoing management happens through **Partner Center > Marketplace > Products**, which serves as your command center for monitoring and optimizing your product portfolio.

The **Overview** section provides comprehensive performance insights including active account counts that show how many customers are using each product, detailed growth metrics tracking activations and deactivations over time, market visibility status showing where products appear across different geographic regions, and trend analysis that helps you identify which products are gaining or losing momentum.

**Configuration options** give you control over every aspect of how products appear and behave in your store. You can adjust retail prices to optimize margins and competitiveness, implement white-label branding to present products under your own identity, configure upgrade paths that encourage customers to move to higher-value tiers, set up free trials that reduce purchase friction, manage team access permissions for internal users, and control add-on availability and pricing.

### Manage store integration
Your store's overall presentation and functionality are controlled through **Partner Center > Marketplace > Manage Store**. Here you can preview how your store appears to customers, adjust visual settings and appearance elements to match your brand, configure sharing and embedding options for website integration, set up contact forms that capture leads, and organize categories to improve customer navigation and product discovery.

### Currency and pricing

**Automatic currency handling** simplifies international operations by providing suggested retail pricing in USD, CAD, and AUD for most products. For businesses operating in other currencies, you can set conversion rates through **Manage Store > Currency**, with all prices automatically calculated based on USD foundations to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Custom pricing flexibility** allows you to override suggested prices when market conditions or business strategy require adjustments. You can set market-specific pricing for different geographic regions, configure promotional pricing for special campaigns, and implement dynamic pricing strategies that respond to seasonal demand or competitive pressures.

## Best Practices

### Product Selection Strategy
Building a successful product portfolio requires thoughtful selection that aligns with your business objectives and customer needs. Start by focusing on products that complement your existing services, creating natural upselling opportunities and reinforcing your market positioning as a comprehensive solution provider.

Consider your target market's most common pain points and business challenges when evaluating potential products. This customer-centric approach ensures that your product additions address real needs rather than simply expanding your catalog. Before committing to any product, carefully evaluate profit margins at your current subscription tier to ensure each addition contributes meaningfully to your revenue goals.

Implement a testing approach by introducing new products to small customer segments before full rollout. This strategy allows you to gather feedback, refine your sales approach, and identify any potential issues before committing significant resources to promoting the product across your entire customer base.

### Store Organization
Effective store organization significantly impacts customer experience and conversion rates. Group related products into logical categories that reflect how customers think about their business needs rather than how you organize your internal operations. This customer-focused categorization helps visitors quickly find relevant solutions.

Use clear, customer-friendly product descriptions that focus on benefits and outcomes rather than technical features. Your customers care more about what a product will do for their business than how it works technically. Maintain consistent pricing strategies across similar products to avoid customer confusion and ensure your pricing appears logical and fair.

Regularly review and update your product offerings based on performance data, customer feedback, and market changes. This ongoing optimization ensures your store remains relevant and competitive as both technology and customer needs evolve.

### Customer Education
Leverage the comprehensive product marketing materials available through the platform to enhance your sales conversations. These professionally developed resources can help you communicate value more effectively and build customer confidence in the solutions you're recommending.

Share relevant case studies and documentation with prospects to provide concrete examples of how similar businesses have succeeded with the products you're offering. Real-world examples build credibility and help prospects visualize the potential impact on their own operations.

Use the FAQ sections proactively to address common concerns before they become objections. By sharing this information early in the sales process, you demonstrate transparency and expertise while reducing the time needed to close deals. Provide clear, honest information about product capabilities and limitations to set appropriate expectations and build long-term customer satisfaction.
