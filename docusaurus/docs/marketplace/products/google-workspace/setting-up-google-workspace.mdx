## Pre-start checklist

Before you're able to use Google Workspace, there are a few things you'll want to configure first:

- **Domain name:** Ensure you have administrative access to your domain name's DNS settings.
- **Business App users**: Ensure you've set up a Business App user for each Google Workspace user. These users should match the domain name you are using above.
  - Example: username@**domainname.com**
- **Secondary email address**: Ensure you have an email address that is not at the above domain name. This will be used as your administrative email address.

## Configuring Business App Users

As your clients will log in to Google Workspace with their Business App credentials, you will need to be sure that each user is set up in Business App.

## Creating a new user

1. **Partner Center > Businesses > Users**, click **Create User**.
   - Alternatively, you can access this option from **Partner Center > Businesses > Accounts > *Account Name* > Users**.
2. Complete the form. Make sure the **Email** has the same domain name as the domain you are configuring.
3. You'll need to add the user to the account you are activating Google Workspace on. Select ![Edit icon](./img/google-workspace/4406959970967.jpg) > **Edit Permissions > Add Account**
4. Locate the account and click the checkbox next to it.
5. Click **Add Accounts**.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each user you are configuring.

## Using an existing user

If you already have users with the same domain as the domain you are configuring Google Workspace for, you can assign those users to the account instead of creating new ones.

If the users have already been assigned to the account, you can skip ahead to the **[Activating Google Workspace](#activating-google-workspace)** step.

1. From **Partner Center > Businesses > Users**, click ![Edit icon](./img/google-workspace/4406959970967.jpg) **> Edit Permissions** next to the user you wish to use.
2. Click **Add Account**.
3. Locate the account and click the checkbox next to it.
4. Click **Add Accounts**.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each user you are configuring.

## Activating Google Workspace

To start using Google Workspace, you’ll first need to activate it on the account.

1. From `Partner Center > Businesses > Accounts`, click on the account.
2. Click **Activate Products > Google Workspace**.
3. Click **Continue**.
4. Check both “I understand…” checkboxes.

At this point, it is important to decide how you would like to configure the product. For details on how to fill out the remainder of the form, please find the scenario below that best aligns with your desired configuration.

---

## Scenario A: Your client will be doing all of the Google Workspace setup work themselves

- **Domain Name**: Enter the domain name your client will be using for Google Workspace. Your client must own this domain or have full administrator access to the domain registrar to complete the setup.
- **Username**: Your client's email address. The domain for this email address must match the domain entered above.
- **Business App User**: Choose the Business App User that matches the username entered above. Adding a Business App user allows your clients to access Google Workspace via the Business App dashboard like other products.
- **Admin Email Address**: The alternative email address that your client will use to configure Google Workspace. For password recovery reasons, Google requires this to be on a different domain name than the one you are configuring.

> This email address will receive the Welcome to Google Workspace email.

---

## Scenario B: You are completing the setup but will not be an administrator

- **Domain Name**: Enter the domain name your client will be using for Google Workspace. Your client must own this domain or have full administrator access to the domain registrar to complete the setup.
- **Username**: Your client's email address. The domain for this email address must match the domain entered above.
- **Business App User**: Choose the Business App User that matches the username entered above. Adding a Business App user allows your clients to access Google Workspace via the Business App dashboard like other products.
- **Admin Email Address**: The alternative email address that your client will use to configure Google Workspace. For password recovery reasons, Google requires this to be on a different domain name than the one you are configuring.

> This email address will receive the Welcome to Google Workspace email.

---

## Scenario C: You are completing the setup and would also like to remain as an administrator

- **Domain Name**: Enter the domain name your client will be using for Google Workspace. Your client must own this domain or have full administrator access to complete the setup.
- **Username**: Enter your email address. This will need to have the same domain as what was entered above. For this reason, you may need to have your client create an email address for you.
- **Business App User**: Choose the Business App User that matches the username entered above.
- **Admin Email Address**: The alternative email address that your client will use to configure Google Workspace. For password recovery reasons, Google requires this to be on a different domain name than the one you are configuring.

> This email address will receive the Welcome to Google Workspace email.

---

Once you've filled in the form, check the **I understand...** checkbox, then click **Purchase**. Google Workspace will begin activating. 

**Please allow up to 10 minutes** for the product to move from a pending state to an active one.

## Google Workspace configuration (admins only)

Before you can proceed, Google Workspace's terms of service must be agreed to by the administrator entered in the previous section. If you are not performing setup work for your client, you can skip this section.

If you are doing setup work for your client, there are just a few more steps you'll need to complete before proceeding.

1. Check the inbox of the email address entered in the **Admin Email Address** field in the previous step. Keep your eyes open for a password reset email entitled "Google Workspace Admin User for...".
2. Click **Reset Password**.
3. Enter a unique password into the **New Password** and **Confirm Password** fields.
4. Click **Reset**.
5. You will be redirected to [https://admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com). Sign in with the email address and password you just set.
6. Google Workspace's Terms of Service will appear each time you access this page until accepted. Once you've agreed to the terms, you will have successfully activated Google Workspace.


## Final steps

1. From `Partner Center > Businesses > Accounts > Account Name`, click **Google Workspace**.
2. Click **Setup** in the sidebar.
3. Follow either the **Recommended** or **Alternate Methods** listed on the verification page.
4. Depending on the DNS host you currently use, updating your TXT and MX Records is completed differently. If you are unsure how to complete this setup, please reach out to your domain name host for further instructions. You can also make use of the View full instructions option where Google will attempt to provide instructions based on the host you are using.


## Linking Google Workspace and Business App users

If you have purchased any additional Google Workspace seats, you'll need to link these to your Business App users.

1. From Partner Center > Businesses > Accounts > Account Name, click Google Workspace under the "Products" section.
2. Find a row that reads "Seat Available For Use". Beside it, click > Create User.
3. Fill in the form. The following fields are available:
- Business App User: A Business App user that matches the same Google Workspace email address.
- First Name and Last Name: The user's name.
- Google Workspace Username: The username you are creating for this user. This will ideally match the Business App user entered above.
- Alternate Email: A secondary email that can be used for password recovery. This should be an email address that is not on the same Google Workspace domain.
4. Complete steps 2-3 for each additional seat you've purchased.

You’re done! Your clients can now access Google Workspace directly through Business App. Please be aware that impersonated users (users who have not logged directly into Business App) are not able to access Google Workspace and will, instead, see the icon grayed out.

## Allowing users to log in directly through Google

If your users want to log in directly through Google, instead of accessing the product through Business App, you can turn off single sign-on. 

- In the product, select "Settings"
- Turn OFF Single Sign-On so users do not have to access the product through the Business App, instead, they can log in through Google.
