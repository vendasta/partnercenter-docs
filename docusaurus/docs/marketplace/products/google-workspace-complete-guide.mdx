## Transferring Existing Google Workspace Subscriptions

### Transfer Overview

**Important Policy Update:** As of March 7th, 2025, Google no longer allows transfers to resellers that previously hosted the same Google Workspace within the last 18 months. Verify client's previous hosting history before initiating transfer.

**Transfer vs. New Subscription Differences:**
- Transferred accounts do NOT require Business App login
- Users continue existing Google Workspace login patterns
- No disruption to existing workflows and data
- Billing transfers to Vendasta while maintaining user experience

### Client Transfer Steps

**Required Client Actions:**
1. Provide client with Vendasta's **Reseller ID: C02e5br85**
2. Direct client to navigate to [admin.google.com/TransferToken](https://admin.google.com/TransferToken)
   - If 404 error occurs, use private/incognito browsing mode
3. Have client click **Generate Transfer Token**
4. Client sends transfer token to partner

### Partner Transfer Processing

**Partner Center Configuration:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Businesses > Accounts > [Account Name]**
2. Click **Activate Products > Google Workspace Transfer**

## SSO Management and Configuration

### Understanding SSO Integration

Single Sign-On (SSO) integration allows users to access Google Workspace through Business App credentials, providing centralized authentication and seamless user experience across all platform products.

### Disabling SSO for Direct Google Access

**Use Case:** Users prefer direct Google login instead of Business App authentication

**SSO Disable Process:**
1. Navigate to **Partner Center**
2. Open account with active Google Workspace
3. Access Google Workspace from Partner Center

![Google Workspace in Partner Center](./img/google-workspace/workspace-sso-1.jpg)

4. Open Workspace Dashboard
5. Select **Settings** from left panel
6. Locate SSO (Single Sign-On) toggle
7. Toggle SSO on or off as needed

**Impact of Disabling SSO:**
- Users can access Google products directly through Google login
- Business App and Google Workspace become separate login experiences
- Reduced integration between platforms
- Users maintain separate authentication for each system

### SSO Best Practices

**When to Keep SSO Enabled:**
- Centralized user management desired
- Single authentication point preferred
- Integration with other Business App products
- Simplified user training and support

**When to Disable SSO:**
- Users prefer native Google experience
- Existing Google workflow dependencies
- Reduced complexity for end users
- Independent Google and Business App usage

## Advanced Management and Troubleshooting

- Plan user hierarchy and permissions before setup
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document user roles and responsibilities
- Regular review and cleanup of unused accounts

- Implement security policies and requirements
- Monitor user access patterns and usage
- Regular security audits and updates

### Integration Monitoring

**Performance Monitoring:**

- Track user adoption and usage patterns
- Identify and resolve integration issues quickly

**Billing and Account Management:**
- Regular review of seat utilization

### Common Issues and Solutions
