# Products - Overview & Management

Products is your centralized command center for understanding, managing, and optimizing all enabled products. From marketing info to metrics and configuration, this is where you control growth trends, settings, and revenue.

## What is Products Overview?

Products Overview serves as your comprehensive dashboard for all products you've enabled to sell, providing real‑time performance insights and granular configuration options that help you optimize your portfolio and enhance customer experience.

This centralized system combines **product management capabilities** that keep all your offerings organized in one location, **performance analytics** that track growth patterns, activations, and revenue trends across your product portfolio, **advanced configuration options** for pricing optimization, white-label branding, and customer experience customization, and **team access controls** that ensure the right people have appropriate permissions to manage and support your products.

The dashboard transforms complex product management tasks into clear, actionable insights that help you make informed decisions about which products to promote, how to price them, and how to optimize their performance in your market.

## Why it matters

Use Products to identify what drives growth and revenue, understand store sales, and track adoption patterns. Configure retail pricing, white‑label branding, upgrade paths, and customer experience.

## How to use Products Overview

Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Products** to access your product management dashboard.

### Product categories

**All Products**: Everything enabled (marketplace and custom) with real‑time status and metrics.

**My Products**: Your custom products and services with full pricing, features, and configuration control.

### Key product information

For each enabled product in your portfolio, the dashboard displays critical business metrics that provide immediate insight into performance and market acceptance.

**Store availability status** is indicated by a check mark that shows whether the product is actively available for customer purchase, either as an individual offering or as part of product packages. This visual indicator helps you quickly identify which products customers can currently access through your store.

**Active account tracking** provides a real-time count of customers currently using each product, giving you immediate visibility into adoption levels and helping you understand which solutions resonate most strongly with your market.

**Growth metrics** present a comprehensive view of product performance including activation numbers that show new customer adoption, pending deactivations that may indicate upcoming churn, completed deactivations that reveal actual customer losses, and net growth calculations over selectable time frames that help you understand overall product momentum and identify trends that require attention.

## Best practices

### Pricing strategy
Effective pricing strategy requires ongoing attention to market dynamics and customer behavior. Conduct regular competitive research to understand how your pricing compares with alternative solutions your customers might consider. This research should include both direct competitors and substitute products that solve similar problems.

Implement value-based pricing by aligning your prices with the specific value each product delivers to your customers' businesses. Products that save significant time or generate measurable revenue for customers can typically command higher prices than those offering convenience benefits. Monitor wholesale costs versus retail pricing continuously to ensure each product contributes meaningfully to your profitability goals.

Develop dynamic pricing capabilities that allow you to adjust prices based on market conditions, seasonal demand, and competitive pressures. This flexibility enables you to maximize revenue during high-demand periods while remaining competitive when market conditions require more aggressive pricing.

### Performance monitoring
Establish a routine of weekly assessment focusing on growth metrics and emerging trends across your product portfolio. This regular review helps you identify patterns early and respond quickly to both opportunities and challenges.

Monitor customer feedback through activation and deactivation patterns, which often reveal important insights about product-market fit and customer satisfaction. Products with high activation rates but also high deactivation rates may indicate onboarding or expectation-setting issues that need attention.

Conduct thorough revenue analysis to understand which products contribute most significantly to business growth, considering both direct revenue and their role in customer acquisition and retention. Adjust your marketing and sales strategies based on customer adoption rates and feedback to continuously improve your market response.

### Configuration management
Maintain brand consistency by ensuring all white-label branding aligns with your overall brand strategy and messaging. This consistency builds customer trust and reinforces your market positioning across all touchpoints.

Optimize customer experience elements including upgrade paths and free trial offerings to maximize conversion rates and customer lifetime value. Regularly test different approaches to understand what resonates most effectively with your target market.

Ensure team access settings support customer service excellence by providing appropriate access levels for different team members while maintaining security and operational efficiency. Leverage automation features like auto-activation where appropriate to reduce administrative overhead and improve customer experience through faster service delivery.
