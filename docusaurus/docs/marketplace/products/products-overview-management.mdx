# Products - Overview & Management

Products is your centralized command center for understanding, managing, and optimizing all enabled products. From marketing info to metrics and configuration, this is where you control growth trends, settings, and revenue.

## What is Products Overview?

A dashboard for all products you’ve enabled to sell, with real‑time performance insights and granular configuration to optimize your portfolio and customer experience.

**Key capabilities**
- Centralized product management
- Performance analytics (growth, activations, revenue)
- Advanced configuration (pricing, branding, CX)
- Team access and permissions

## Why it matters

Use Products to identify what drives growth and revenue, understand store sales, and track adoption patterns. Configure retail pricing, white‑label branding, upgrade paths, and customer experience.

## How to use Products Overview

Navigate to **Partner Center > Marketplace > Products** to access your product management dashboard.

### Product categories

**All Products**: Everything enabled (marketplace and custom) with real‑time status and metrics.

**My Products**: Your custom products and services with full pricing, features, and configuration control.

### Key product information

For each enabled product, you'll see critical business metrics:

**Selling in store**: Check mark shows active availability (individual or in packages).

**Active accounts**: Real‑time count of customers using the product.

**Growth metrics**: Activations, pending deactivations, deactivations, and net growth over selectable time frames.

Automatic price updates: sync with integration providers (nightly) and apply at the customer level.

#### Auto‑activation

Enable "Auto‑activate when ordered" for instant deployment and reduced admin work—especially useful for digital products.

![Auto-activate setting](./img/marketplace/products/auto-activate.png)

For Standard products (e.g., Local SEO, Reputation Management, Campaigns Pro, Social Marketing, Website, Advertising Intelligence), toggle Automatic Activation in Product Info. Applies when new accounts are created (not CSV uploads or store‑created accounts).

#### White‑label branding

Many marketplace products support white‑labeling so you can present them as your own.

Configuration: Product Info > enable "Customize the product name and icon" > set name and icon > save.

Customize upgrade modals (title, content, CTA, images/branding) and preview in real time.
