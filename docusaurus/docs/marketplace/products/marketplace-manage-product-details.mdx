# Marketplace - Manage Product Details

The Manage Product Details is your comprehensive guide to managing various aspects of products within the Marketplace. This page serves as a single location for Partners to efficiently navigate customer product settings to better suit their business needs. 

Why is Manage Product Details important?

Centralized Management: The Product Info page serves as a centralized hub for partners to manage various product settings, providing convenience and efficiency in product administration.
Customization and Enhanced Customer Experience: White-label branding options to personalize products, and enhance brand consistency, as well as flexibility with pricing, and upgrade paths to streamline the customer experience and align it with a Partners's current process
How to use Manage Products:

Changing Retail Prices of Products

By default, the Retail Price for a product is set by the product’s vendor as the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). If a product is sold at a different price, it is important to set the Retail Price to ensure that the revenue reported in the platform is accurate. 
To set the retail price for a product:

Go to Partner Center > Marketplace > Products.
Click on the product that an adjustment to the retail price is required.  
Once in the Overview, select the Product Info tab.
By default, changes will be for All Markets unless a Market is selected (If applicable)
Select the Dropdown next to the Edition that will be adjusted, and then Edit 
Add a Setup Fee, change the retail price, or adjust the billing period 
Save the Changes

**Automatic Price Update** - Under this option you are able to turn on automatic price updates from your integration provider (ie Vendasta, Constant Contact, Facebook, etc). If a price changes, then a job runs every night at midnight that will update all prices at the customer level.

**Auto-Activate** - This will automatically activate your products so you don't have to do it manually.
