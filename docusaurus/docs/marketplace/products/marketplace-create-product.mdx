## How to Use the Create Product Functionality

### Quickstart Product Creation

You can start creating a product by going to `Marketplace > Products`. Select the **Create Product** button in the upper right corner. This will take Partners through a Modal, with 4 easy steps to create a Product:

1. **Basic Info**
    - **Product Name** - The name of the product or service. This will be displayed to Partner Center admins, salespeople, and customers.
    - **Product Type** - Whether it is best classified as a product or service.
    - **Icon Image** - The product's icon is one of the first impressions that customers will have of the product. Keep it simple, refrain from using text in the image, and ensure it fits well in a circle.

2. **Pricing**
    - **Recurring Subscription or One-Time Fee** - When a product is billed as a subscription, the customer will be required to make a monthly payment to continue using the product. If a customer discontinues their subscription, the product will continue to be active until the end of the billing period, at which point the product can be canceled. If the product requires a recurring payment, select **Subscription** to set the frequency (monthly or yearly) with which the customer is billed.
    - **Cost and Retail Pricing** - Cost should be the sum of all direct costs associated with making the product - adding in this field will determine margins in the Platform. Retail is the price that will be charged to customers for the product. If the product is set to be billed as a subscription, the amount set as a Retail Price will be charged regularly at the frequency specified.

3. **Marketing**
    - **Marketing description** - Provide a concise and captivating paragraph or two that communicates what the product is, why it’s unique, and why users will love it.
    - **Key selling points** - Provide 3-6 unique value propositions about the product.

4. **Confirmation**
    - Choose whether to save the product as a draft and continue editing in Vendor Center or to **Publish and Enable** the product.
        - **Continue editing in Vendor Center** - The product will be saved as a draft and can continue to be edited in Vendor Center where additional features including order forms, advanced integrations, and HTML for marketing are available.
        - **Publish and Enable** - The product is published and enabled, it can now be packaged and added to the Store.

### Advanced Product Creation

You can start creating a product by going to `Vendor Center > Products`. Select the **Add Product** button in the upper right corner. This will take Partners through a Modal to start creating a Product:

1. **Name & Type**
    - **Product Name** - The name of the product or service. This will be displayed to Partner Center admins, salespeople, and customers.
    - **Product Type** - Whether it is best classified as a product or service.
    - **Icon Image** - The product's icon is one of the first impressions that customers will have of the product. Keep it simple, refrain from using text in the image, and ensure it fits well in a circle.
    - **Short Description** - The "tagline", 200 characters or less, that appears in previews of the product in the Store and marketing material.

2. The following tabs will now become available for you to edit:
    - **Product Info**
    - **Marketing**
    - **Integration**
    - **Add-ons**

##### Pricing

Here you can set the pricing model that your product follows, including defining the billing period, subscription terms, retail price, and trial availability.

**Note**: The price fields in Vendor Center are currently always set in USD. For partners operating in currencies other than USD, Retail Prices can be set for enabled products in the currency you select for your store in `Partner Center > Marketplace > Manage Store`.

- **Pricing Model** - Choose between Fixed Price, Variable Price, or Contact Sales, depending on the pricing model selected different settings will be available.
    - **Fixed Price** - Customers will be billed a fixed price for the product one time or each billing period.
    - **Wholesale Price** - This is the sum of all direct costs associated with making the product - adding in this field will determine margins in the Platform.
    - **Retail Price** - Retail is the default price that will be charged to customers for the product. Note: This can be adjusted in the Store on a Product basis, but this will remain the default.
    - **Setup Fee** - Adds a one-time charge when a customer purchases the product.

- **Billing Period** - This will set how often a customer is billed for the Product; One-Time, Monthly or Yearly.
- **Subscription Terms** - Predetermine an initial and renewal commitment period for the product’s subscription. For the duration of a subscription term, the customer must remain subscribed to, and billed for, the product. The initial subscription term becomes effective from the date of purchase. A recurring subscription term becomes effective (and recurs) at the end of the initial commitment period.
- **Trials** - Enable trials to specify the number of days in which customers can use the product at no cost.
- **Editions** - Editions are different versions of the product that represent levels of service, functionality, or pricing plans. Customers can purchase an edition of the product and upgrade or downgrade to a different edition as required. Editions of a product share marketing material and add-ons, but each edition has its price settings.

- **Advanced Setting** - Allow multiple purchases per account (disables add-on support) - By default, only a single instance of a product can be active on an account at any time. Enabling this setting will allow customers to purchase this product multiple times on a single account. Note that add-ons cannot be used with products that can be purchased multiple times.

    - **Variable Price** - Using this pricing model, you can set a minimum price and allow your customers to choose how much they want to spend when ordering or buying your product.
        - **Minimum Price** - When customers choose the amount to spend on your product, and when Partner Center users request to change an account’s subscription price for this product, they’ll be prevented from choosing an amount lower than the minimum price you’ve set.
        - **Management Fee** - Charge an additional fee, either set dollar or percentage of variable price, each renewal on top of the variable price.
        - **Setup Fee** - Adds a one-time charge when a customer purchases the product.

- **Contact Sales** - Selecting this option will hide the price of your product from customers, requiring them to contact a salesperson for pricing information. Use this option if your product requires more detailed or case-based pricing options. Note that your customers won’t be able to purchase Contact Sales products from your Store using the Shopping Cart because these products have no price attached to them.

#### Product Activation

These settings affect what happens when your product is activated, canceled, or deactivated for an account, including messaging, notifications, and order forms.

- **Activation message** - The message you enter here will be displayed to Partner Center admins, salespeople, and customers when they submit an order for the product. Use this message to outline service timelines, provide supplementary information or instructions about the order process, or simply thank the customer for their order.
- **Notifications** - A notification will be sent to the email addresses entered here when the product is activated, canceled, or deactivated. To add more than one email address, click the + Add recipient button.
- **Required Products** - Choose one or more products that customers must purchase before they can purchase or use the product.
- **Order Form** - One of the key benefits of integrating your product through the Vendor Center is the ability to create custom order forms to request specific information from your customers when they purchase your product.
- **Work Orders** - With Vendor-Task Integration and system-generated tasks, fulfillment teams can integrate tasks and projects for customers, while providing Admins and Salespeople with the capability to track and manage the work generated and associated with the products or services sold in your store.

#### Country Availability

Select the regions where the product is available for purchase and use. Customers whose business addresses are outside the regions selected won’t be able to purchase or use the product.

**Note**: If the product can be purchased and used regardless of the customer’s location, leave this field blank.
