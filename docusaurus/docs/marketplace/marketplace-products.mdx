# Marketplace - Manage Product Details

This article will explain all of the different fields that need to be filled out when creating a product in the Vendasta Marketplace.

## Retail Pricing

Retail pricing is the price charged to the end customer. This end customer price will be marked up automatically based on a partners markup tier.

**Automatic Price Update** - Under this option you are able to turn on automatic price updates from your integration provider (ie Vendasta, Constant Contact, Facebook, etc). If a price changes, then a job runs every night at midnight that will update all prices at the customer level.

**Auto-Activate** - This will automatically activate your products so you don't have to do it manually.

**White Labeling** - Turning this option on lets your partners white-label your product with their name. Under most circumstances you'll want to leave this option turned on to allow partners to customize the selling experience to their customers.

**Upgrades and Downgrades** - If there are multiple pricing tiers of your product a customer might want to upgrade or downgrade between the different tiers.

**Free Trials** - You can configure a free trial of your product. Free Trials are a tool to give full access to the product temporarily. We automatically switch to paid billing after the trial period.

**Configurations:**
- Days of Free Trial - How many days customers are allowed to use the product for free
- Payment Required - If payment is required, a credit card is required at signup
- Auto Pay - If "Auto Pay" is selected, billing will start automatically when the free trial is finished

**Team Access** - This setting allows you to configure whether your partners can utilize the Team feature when selling your product.

Teams is a feature that allows the partner to assign a team member to a customer. By checking this option, partners can assign team members to customers who have your product.
