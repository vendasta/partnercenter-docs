# Marketplace - Overview

## What is Marketplace?

Marketplace is a centralized platform for selling digital products to local businesses. You can take new products to market instantly, consolidate vendor relationships, and deliver value from a single login. It integrates with the broader platform so you can handle sales, billing, and fulfillment in one place.

## Why it matters

Marketplace streamlines sales and operations so you can grow revenue with less friction. When you consolidate your product offerings in one place, you eliminate the complexity of managing multiple vendor relationships and billing systems. 

The platform enables **streamlined sales** by providing one unified location to sell, deliver, and fulfill products, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks during the customer journey. This consolidation means you can focus on selling rather than juggling different systems and processes.

**Product‑led growth** becomes possible when clients can explore and self‑order without requiring direct sales time from your team. This self-service capability reduces your operational overhead while giving customers the autonomy to discover and purchase solutions at their own pace.

**Revenue growth** accelerates through access to 250+ curated products that you can start reselling with a single click using your white‑label store. This instant product catalog expansion means you can quickly respond to customer needs without the typical delays of vendor negotiations and integration work.

**Centralized management** through a single dashboard allows you to track metrics, set pricing, and manage purchases across all your products and vendors, giving you clear visibility into your business performance and customer behavior.

## What you can do

Marketplace provides comprehensive tools for product discovery, store management, and sales enablement, giving you everything needed to build a successful digital product business.

### Discover Products
The product discovery experience helps you find, evaluate, and compare solutions that match your customers' needs. You can browse through 250+ curated products using sophisticated search and filtering capabilities. Each product listing shows wholesale costs across different subscription tiers alongside suggested retail prices, making it easy to evaluate potential profit margins before committing to sell a product.

When you open detailed marketing pages, you'll find comprehensive information including product features and benefits, screenshots, vendor information, and all the resources you need to effectively sell the solution to your customers.

### Manage Store
Your white‑label store serves as the primary customer-facing interface for your digital products. Through the store management tools, you can customize every aspect of the theme, appearance, and settings to match your brand identity. The platform handles the technical complexity of enabling shopping cart functionality and payment processing, while giving you control over customer account management and auto‑assignment rules that determine how new customers are organized within your system.

### Products
The products section serves as your central command center for controlling enabled products and monitoring their performance. Here you can view detailed growth metrics and track active accounts across your entire product portfolio. The configuration options allow you to set retail pricing that maximizes your margins, implement white‑label branding to present products as your own, and manage add‑ons and customer‑facing marketing content that supports your sales efforts.

### Packages
Package creation transforms individual products into compelling value‑based offers that appeal to different customer segments. You can create custom combinations at various price points, taking advantage of recommended packages that have been proven successful, or design entirely new bundles. The filtering system helps you organize packages by status, product type, or category, and the shopping cart integration enables seamless customer purchases.

### Create your own products
Beyond marketplace products, you can list your own services and solutions within the same system. This capability includes setting categories and pricing structures, creating detailed marketing pages with HTML support for custom formatting, and integrating your products with external systems via webhooks and single sign-on. The platform supports unlimited add‑ons, giving you flexibility in how you structure and price your offerings.

### My Purchases
When you purchase solutions for your own business operations, the My Purchases section helps you track and manage these investments. You can access documentation, find vendor contact information, and locate support resources, ensuring you get maximum value from the tools you've invested in.

## How to use Marketplace

### Get started with product discovery
Begin your Marketplace journey by navigating to `Marketplace > Discover Products`, where you can choose between viewing all available products or exploring the featured collection curated by Vendasta. Use the filtering system to narrow down products by category, or employ the search functionality to find specific solutions that match your customers' needs.

When you find a product that interests you, open it to view comprehensive details including pricing structures, feature descriptions, and vendor information. Once you're confident about adding a product to your portfolio, click `Start Selling` to instantly add it to your store at the suggested retail price.

### Set up your store
Your store setup begins at `Marketplace > Manage Store`, where you can transform the default interface into a branded experience that reflects your business identity. Customize the theme and appearance to match your visual brand, ensuring consistency across all customer touchpoints.

Configure payment processing and account settings to streamline the customer experience. Auto‑assignment rules can be set up to automatically organize new customers into appropriate categories, reducing administrative overhead. Before going live, embed your store on your website and conduct thorough testing of the checkout process to ensure everything works smoothly for customers.

### Manage products
Ongoing product management happens in `Marketplace > Products`, where you can monitor the performance of your enabled products. Track key metrics including activations, deactivations, and net growth to understand which products resonate with your market.

Fine-tune your approach by adjusting retail pricing to optimize margins, implementing white-label branding to present products as your own, and configuring add‑ons and upgrade paths that maximize customer lifetime value. Keep your customer‑facing marketing pages updated with relevant information that supports your sales efforts.

Package creation begins at `Marketplace > Packages`, where you can either explore pre-built recommended packages that have proven successful for other partners, or click `Create Package` to design custom combinations that address specific market needs.

Configure package contents carefully, ensuring the combination provides clear value to customers while maintaining profitable pricing. Set availability parameters and enable shopping cart purchases for self-service buying, or configure packages to be added to invoices for more consultative sales approaches.

Expand beyond marketplace offerings by creating custom products through `Marketplace > Products > Create Product`. Start by entering the basic information including product name, type classification, and uploading an icon that represents your offering.

Set up pricing structures by choosing between subscription or one‑time fee models, then configure categories that help customers find your products.
