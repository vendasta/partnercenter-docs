# Business Categories and Taxonomies

## What are Business Categories and Taxonomies?

Business categories and taxonomies are classification systems that help organize and identify different types of businesses in your account database. Categories define what type of business an account represents, while taxonomies provide more detailed subcategorizations and industry-specific classifications.

## Why are Business Categories Important?

Proper business categorization enables:

- **Product Feature Optimization**: Many products offer category-specific features and functionality
- **Accurate Reporting**: Category-based analytics and benchmarking against similar businesses
- **Competitive Analysis**: Identification of relevant competitors within the same business category
- **Targeted Marketing**: Category-specific campaigns and communications
- **Service Customization**: Tailored service delivery based on industry requirements
- **Integration Success**: Category-appropriate third-party integrations and data sources

## What's Included with Business Categories?

### Category Classification System
- Primary business categories for main business focus
- Secondary categories for additional business activities
- Industry-specific subcategories and specializations
- Service vs. retail business distinctions

### Taxonomy Hierarchy
- Broad industry classifications (e.g., Healthcare, Retail, Professional Services)
- Specific business types within industries (e.g., Restaurants, Auto Repair, Legal Services)
- Specialized subcategories (e.g., Italian Restaurants, Brake Repair, Personal Injury Law)
- Geographic and demographic modifiers when applicable

## How to Select Business Categories

### Understanding Category Structure

**Primary Categories** (Most Important):
- **Professional Services**: Legal, medical, consulting, accounting
- **Retail**: Clothing, electronics, home goods, specialty retail
- **Food & Dining**: Restaurants, cafes, catering, food trucks
- **Health & Medical**: Doctors, dentists, clinics, wellness centers
- **Automotive**: Dealerships, repair shops, parts suppliers
- **Home Services**: Contractors, plumbers, electricians, landscaping
- **Beauty & Personal Care**: Salons, spas, fitness centers
- **Real Estate**: Agents, property management, mortgage services

**Secondary Categories** (Additional Services):
- Complementary services offered by the business
- Seasonal or occasional business activities
- Emerging business lines or expansions
- Historical services no longer primary focus

### Category Selection Process

**For New Account Creation:**
1. **Identify primary business focus** - what the business is primarily known for
2. **Select most specific category** available that matches the business
3. **Add secondary categories** for significant additional services (up to 2-3 total)
4. **Consider customer perspective** - how do customers typically find this business?
5. **Review category implications** for product features and integrations

**Category Selection Best Practices:**
- **Choose specificity over generality** - select "Italian Restaurant" over "Restaurant" when available
- **Prioritize customer viewpoint** - how do customers search for and categorize this business?
- **Consider service delivery model** - online, in-person, service area, or storefront
- **Account for primary revenue source** - categorize based on main income generator

If no suitable category exists for a business, select "Other" but note that some product features may be limited or unavailable.

## How to Handle Special Business Types

### Multi-Category Businesses

**Businesses with Multiple Focus Areas:**
1. **Identify primary revenue source** for main category selection
2. **Add secondary categories** for significant additional services
3. **Consider creating separate accounts** for distinctly different business lines
4. **Document business model** in account notes for future reference

**Example Scenarios:**
- **Restaurant with Catering**: Primary = Restaurant, Secondary = Catering
- **Auto Dealer with Service**: Primary = Auto Dealer, Secondary = Auto Repair
- **Medical Practice with Spa**: Consider separate accounts or primary = Medical

### Service Area vs. Storefront Businesses

**Service Area Businesses:**
- Focus on service delivery categories rather than location-based categories
- Emphasize expertise and service type over geographic presence
- Consider territory coverage in category selection
- Examples: Plumbing, HVAC, Consulting, Home Cleaning

**Storefront Businesses:**
- Emphasize location-based categories and customer attraction
- Focus on product or service categories that customers physically visit for
- Consider foot traffic and local search implications
- Examples: Retail stores, restaurants, salons, medical offices

### Franchise and Chain Businesses

**Franchise Locations:**
- Use specific business category rather than "Franchise" generic category
- Include franchise brand characteristics in category selection
- Consider local market variations in service offerings
- Maintain consistency across franchise locations while allowing for local differences

**Chain Store Locations:**
- Apply consistent categorization across all chain locations
- Account for regional variations in product or service offerings
- Use location-specific subcategories when available
- Coordinate category changes across multiple locations

## How to Update and Maintain Categories

### When to Review Business Categories

**Regular Review Triggers:**
- **Annual account reviews**: Verify categories still accurately represent the business
- **Business model changes**: When businesses expand, pivot, or change focus
- **Product updates**: When new category-specific features become available
- **Performance analysis**: When category-based reporting seems inconsistent

**Category Change Indicators:**
- Customer feedback about service categorization
- Significant changes in business revenue sources
- Addition of major new service lines
- Competitive positioning shifts

### Category Update Process

**Making Category Changes:**
1. **Review current categories** and their accuracy
2. **Assess impact** of category changes on existing features and integrations
3. **Update primary and secondary categories** as appropriate
4. **Test category-dependent features** after changes
5. **Document reasons** for category changes in account notes
6. **Communicate changes** to relevant team members
