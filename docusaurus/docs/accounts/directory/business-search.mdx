## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Why can't I find a business I know exists?</summary>

Businesses might not appear in search if they're very new, unlisted in public directories, have recently changed names, or are service area businesses without physical storefronts. Try searching by address or use manual account creation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I search for businesses that have recently changed names?</summary>

Try searching for both the old and new business names, search by address instead of name, or use the business owner's name if known. You may need to use manual account creation for recently rebranded businesses.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I search for businesses by phone number?</summary>

Some systems support reverse phone number lookup. Try entering the phone number in the search field, or use it to verify the correct business when multiple similar results appear.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do if the search returns multiple locations for the same business?</summary>

Select the specific location you need to create an account for. Each physical location typically needs its own account, even for the same business brand or franchise.

</details>

<details>
