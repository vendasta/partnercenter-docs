# Create User Lists & Bulk Import Users

After [creating a list](./create-a-list.mdx) in Business App, you can import users via CSV file. User lists make it easy to import, view, and manage large lists of users at once.

## How to Import Users via CSV

### Step 1: Select "Import users" (CSV)

From your list page, select the "Import users" (CSV) button to open the import modal.

### Step 2: Download the CSV Template

If this is your first time importing users, download the CSV template to ensure you have the correct formatting. You can also use a previously exported user list as a template.

### Step 3: Fill Out the CSV Template

Open the template in a spreadsheet program like Excel or Google Sheets and fill in the required fields:

- **email**: The user's email address (required)
- **first_name**: User's first name
- **last_name**: User's last name
- **job_title**: User's position or job title
- **department**: User's department
- **address**: User's physical address
- **city**: User's city
- **region**: User's state/province
- **country**: User's country
- **postal_code**: User's zip/postal code
- **phone**: User's phone number

Only the email is required, but adding additional information will help you better segment and target your users.

### Step 4: Upload Your CSV File

Return to the import modal in Business App and:

1. Upload your CSV file by clicking "Choose File"
2. Preview your data to ensure everything looks correct
3. Click "Import"

### Step 5: Wait for Import Completion

After clicking "Import," the system will process your file. This may take a few minutes depending on the size of your list. You'll receive a notification when the import is complete.

## Troubleshooting Import Errors

### Common CSV Format Issues

- **Invalid email format**: Ensure all email addresses follow the standard format (e.g., user@domain.com)
- **Duplicate emails**: Each email address should appear only once in your CSV
- **Special characters**: Some special characters may cause import errors
- **Incorrect column headers**: Make sure your column headers match exactly with the template

### What to Do If Your Import Fails

1. Download the error report (if available)
2. Fix the identified issues in your CSV file
3. Try importing again

## Best Practices for User Lists

- Keep lists organized by creating clear naming conventions
- Regularly update your lists to maintain accuracy
- Use tags and custom fields to further segment your users
- Export your lists periodically as a backup
