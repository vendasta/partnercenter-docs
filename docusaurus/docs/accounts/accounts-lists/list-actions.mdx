After selecting **Export Account Data**, you will be taken to the List's **History** page. Once the export has finished, you will be able to download the CSV by clicking the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](./img/accounts/lists/menu-icon.png), then **Account NAP/Product CSV**.

## Add Tags

Allows you to add tags to every account in the List. This is useful should you wish to use tags to filter accounts later.

## Add To Campaign

Allows you to add the List to an email marketing campaign. This will add all the users and contacts that are assigned to the accounts in the List to that campaign. [Learn more](/accounts/email-marketing/campaigns)

## Pause Campaigns

Allows you to pause a currently active campaign for all the users and contacts that are assigned to the accounts in the List.  
It's little confusing with the status when it's paused. "Paused" will not appear as a separate status, but if there is a campaign in "ongoing" status, pausing it will change the status to "published".

## Create Multi-Location Group

## Create/Refresh Snapshot

Depending on the state of the account, one of three things will happen:

- If there has never been a Snapshot Report created for the account, a new Snapshot Report will be created.
- If an account has previously had a Snapshot Report that has expired, that Snapshot Report will be refreshed.
- If an account currently has an active Snapshot Report (created in the last 7 days), that account will be skipped.
