## How to Create Account Lists Manually

### Basic List Creation

To create a new account list:

1. Navigate to **Accounts** > **Lists**
2. Click `Create List` or `New List`
3. **Configure list settings**:
   - **List Name**: Choose a descriptive, meaningful name
   - **Description**: Add details about the list purpose and contents
   - **List Type**: Select static (fixed membership) or dynamic (criteria-based)
   - **Visibility**: Set privacy and sharing permissions
4. **Choose creation method**:
   - Manual selection of individual accounts
   - Filter-based automatic population
   - Import from CSV file
5. Click `Create List` to establish the list structure

### Manual Account Selection

**Adding Accounts Individually:**
1. **Start with an empty list** created through the process above
2. Click `Add Accounts` within your new list
3. **Search and select accounts** to include:
   - Use the search bar to find specific businesses
   - Browse through your account database
   - Apply filters to narrow account selection
   - Select accounts using checkboxes
4. **Review selected accounts** before adding
5. Click `Add Selected Accounts` to populate the list

**Selection Best Practices:**
- **Start with clear criteria** for list membership
- **Use consistent naming conventions** for easy list identification
- **Group accounts logically** for intended use case
- **Document list purpose** in the description field

### Organizing Lists by Purpose

**Common List Organization Strategies:**

**Geographic Lists:**
- "West Coast Clients" - accounts in western states
- "Downtown Seattle" - accounts in specific city areas
- "Territory 1" - accounts assigned to specific sales territories

**Industry-Based Lists:**
- "Restaurant Clients" - food service businesses
- "Medical Practices" - healthcare providers
- "Auto Dealers" - automotive businesses

**Operational Lists:**
- "New Accounts" - recently created accounts needing onboarding
- "High-Value Clients" - accounts with premium service levels
- "Renewal Candidates" - accounts approaching contract renewal

**Campaign Lists:**
- "Q4 Promotion" - accounts targeted for specific campaigns
- "Webinar Attendees" - accounts that participated in events
- "Survey Participants" - accounts for feedback collection

## How to Create Filter-Based Lists

### Automatic List Population

Create lists that automatically include accounts meeting specific criteria:

1. **Start creating a new list** as described above
2. **Choose "Filter-Based" or "Dynamic List"** option
3. **Configure filter criteria**:
   - **Business Categories**: Select specific business types
   - **Geographic Filters**: Choose markets, states, or cities
   - **Product Filters**: Include accounts with specific products or missing products
   - **Date Filters**: Accounts created within specific timeframes
   - **Tag Filters**: Accounts with specific tags or labels
   - **Lifecycle Stages**: Accounts in specific customer journey stages

**Example Filter Combinations:**
- **"Restaurant Prospects"**: Category = Restaurants + Lifecycle Stage = Prospect
- **"West Coast Premium"**: Market = West Coast + Product = Premium Edition
- **"New Medical Accounts"**: Category = Medical + Created Date = Last 30 Days

### Dynamic vs. Static Lists

**Dynamic Lists (Criteria-Based):**
- **Automatically update** as accounts change and new accounts are added
- **Maintain relevance** without manual maintenance
- **Ideal for ongoing campaigns** and operational workflows
- **Examples**: "New Accounts This Month," "Accounts Missing Product X"

**Static Lists (Fixed Membership):**
- **Fixed account membership** that doesn't change automatically
- **Manual control** over list contents
- **Ideal for specific campaigns** with defined audiences
- **Examples**: "Q3 Survey Participants," "VIP Client List"

### Advanced Filter Configuration

**Complex Filter Logic:**
1. **Combine multiple criteria** using AND/OR logic
2. **Create nested conditions** for sophisticated filtering
3. **Use exclusion criteria** to remove unwanted accounts
4. **Test filter logic** before finalizing list creation

**Example Advanced Filters:**
```
Category = (Restaurants OR Retail) 
AND Market = (California OR Oregon) 
AND Product Status = Active 
AND NOT Tag = "Do Not Contact"
```

## How to Import Account Lists

### CSV Import Process

For large lists or existing data:

1. **Navigate to list import** functionality
2. **Download the CSV template** for proper formatting
3. **Prepare your CSV file** with account identifiers:
   - Business names (exact matches preferred)
   - Customer IDs or account identifiers
   - Phone numbers or addresses for matching
   - Additional identifying information
4. **Upload the CSV file** and review import preview
5. **Resolve any matching issues** for accounts not found
6. **Execute the import** to create your list

### CSV Preparation Best Practices

**File Format Requirements:**
- **Use exact business names** as they appear in your system
- **Include identifying information** like addresses or phone numbers
- **Consistent data formatting** for better matching accuracy
- **Remove duplicates** before importing
- **Validate account existence** in your system beforehand

**Matching Strategies:**
- **Primary matching** on business name and address
- **Secondary matching** on phone number or customer ID
- **Manual review** of unmatched entries
- **Fallback options** for partial matches

## How to Manage List Settings and Permissions

### List Configuration Options

**Access Control:**
1. **Set list visibility** (private, team, or organization-wide)
2. **Configure edit permissions** for list modification
3. **Assign list ownership** to specific team members
4. **Set sharing restrictions** for list access

**List Maintenance:**
- **Update list descriptions** as purposes change
- **Modify filter criteria** for dynamic lists
- **Archive outdated lists** rather than deleting
- **Document list usage** and modification history

### Team Collaboration

**Sharing Lists Effectively:**
1. **Use descriptive names** that indicate purpose and scope
2. **Provide clear descriptions** of list contents and intended use
3. **Set appropriate permissions** for team access needs
4. **Coordinate list usage** to avoid conflicts
5. **Regular review** of shared lists for continued relevance

**List Naming Conventions:**
- **Include purpose**: "Campaign_Q4Promotion_Restaurants"
- **Add date/time references**: "NewAccounts_2024Q1"
- **Specify scope**: "Territory_WestCoast_ActiveClients"
- **Use consistent formatting**: Follow established team patterns

## List Quality and Maintenance

### Maintaining List Accuracy

**Regular Review Procedures:**
1. **Monthly list audits** to verify continued relevance
2. **Remove obsolete accounts** that no longer meet criteria
3. **Add new qualifying accounts** to existing lists
4. **Update filter criteria** for dynamic lists as needed
5. **Archive completed campaign lists** for historical reference

**Quality Assurance:**
- **Verify account information** before adding to important lists
- **Check for duplicate accounts** within lists
- **Validate list criteria** match intended use cases
- **Test bulk operations** on small list samples before full execution

### Performance Optimization

**Large List Management:**
- **Break large lists** into smaller, manageable segments
- **Use specific criteria** to reduce list size and improve performance
- **Consider geographic or categorical splitting** for very large lists
- **Monitor system performance** when working with extensive lists

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between static and dynamic lists?</summary>

Static lists have fixed membership that only changes when you manually add or remove accounts. Dynamic lists automatically update based on filter criteria, adding new accounts that meet the criteria and removing accounts that no longer qualify.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How many accounts can I include in a single list?</summary>

List size limits vary by system, but most platforms can handle thousands of accounts per list. For very large lists, consider breaking them into smaller segments for better performance and easier management.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can one account belong to multiple lists?</summary>

Yes, accounts can be members of multiple lists simultaneously. This allows for flexible organization where the same account might be included in territory lists, campaign lists, and product-specific lists.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I handle accounts that no longer meet list criteria?</summary>

For dynamic lists, accounts are automatically removed when they no longer meet criteria. For static lists, you need to manually remove accounts or convert to dynamic lists with updated criteria.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I copy or duplicate existing lists?</summary>

Most systems allow list duplication, which is useful for creating similar lists with slight variations or for creating backup copies before making significant changes to important lists.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens to lists when I delete accounts?</summary>

Deleted accounts are automatically removed from all lists. Some systems may provide warnings before account deletion if the account belongs to important lists.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I share lists with team members?</summary>

Use list sharing settings to grant view or edit access to specific team members. Consider creating team-specific lists for collaborative work while maintaining private lists for individual use.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I export account lists for use outside the system?</summary>

Yes, most list systems allow exporting to CSV or Excel formats. This is useful for external analysis, reporting, or importing into other systems for specialized campaigns.
