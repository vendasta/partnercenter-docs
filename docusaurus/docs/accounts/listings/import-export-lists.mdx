## How to Import Account Lists

### Preparing Data for Import

**CSV File Preparation:**
1. **Download import template** from your system
2. **Structure your data** according to template requirements:
   - **Required Fields**: Business name, address components, contact information
   - **Optional Fields**: Categories, tags, custom identifiers, additional details
   - **Data Formatting**: Consistent phone numbers, addresses, and text formatting
   - **Character Encoding**: UTF-8 encoding for special characters and international data

**Data Quality Best Practices:**
- **Remove duplicates** before importing
- **Standardize formatting** for phone numbers, addresses, and business names
- **Validate addresses** using mapping services when possible
- **Clean data** by removing extra spaces, special characters, or formatting issues
- **Verify business categories** match available system options

### Import Process Execution

**Step-by-Step Import:**
1. Navigate to **Accounts** > **Lists** > **Import Lists**
2. **Upload your prepared CSV file**
3. **Map data fields** between your file and system fields:
   - **Automatic mapping**: System attempts to match column headers
   - **Manual mapping**: Manually assign columns to appropriate fields
   - **Custom field mapping**: Map additional data to custom attributes
4. **Review import preview**:
   - **Validation results**: Check for errors, warnings, or data issues
   - **Duplicate detection**: Review potential duplicates identified by system
   - **Import summary**: Verify total records and field mapping accuracy
5. **Configure import options**:
   - **List creation**: Create new list or add to existing list
   - **Duplicate handling**: Skip, merge, or create separate records
   - **Error handling**: Continue on errors or stop import process
6. **Execute import** and monitor progress

### Import Validation and Error Handling

- **Duplicate records**: Multiple entries for the same business
- **Category mismatches**: Business categories not available in system
- **Address validation failures**: Addresses that cannot be verified or geocoded

**Error Resolution Strategies:**
1. **Review error report** provided after import attempt
2. **Correct data issues** in your source file:
   - **Fix formatting errors** in phone numbers and addresses
   - **Add missing required information**
   - **Resolve duplicate records** before re-importing
   - **Verify business categories** against available options
3. **Re-import corrected data** using same process
4. **Manual creation** for problematic records that can't be automatically imported
