You can configure user notification and permission settings when bulk importing accounts. After uploading a CSV file with account and user data, you can determine whether new users can:

- Access Business App
- Receive notifications
- Receive the Welcome Email

To configure these settings, go to the **Manage Users** page and bulk update the new users or update the new users individually.

### How does it work?

To access these settings:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Accounts** > [Manage Accounts](https://partners.vendasta.com/manage-accounts).
2. Click on the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](/img/accounts/bulk-import-accounts/menu_icon.png) in the upper right corner of the screen. Click **Import Accounts (CSV Upload)**.

3. Follow the Import Wizard to upload a CSV file and map fields (Steps 1-2).
4. Select the options you would like to enable for new users in your CSV file. If you unselect each of these options, the users can still receive marketing campaign emails.
