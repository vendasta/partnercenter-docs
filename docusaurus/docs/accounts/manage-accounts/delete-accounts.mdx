# Delete Accounts

## What is Account Deletion?

Account deletion is the permanent removal of business accounts from your Business App system. This process removes all associated data including user access, product history, reporting data, and account settings.

## Why Consider Account Deletion?

Account deletion may be necessary for:

- **Data Cleanup**: Removing duplicate or test accounts that clutter your system
- **Business Closure**: Permanently removing accounts for businesses that have permanently closed
- **Contract Termination**: Removing accounts when service relationships end permanently
- **Compliance Requirements**: Meeting data retention and privacy regulations
- **System Maintenance**: Cleaning up obsolete or inactive accounts

:::warning
Account deletion is permanent and irreversible. All data associated with the account will be lost, including historical reporting data, user access records, and product configurations.

Before deleting any account, complete these steps:

1. **Verify deletion necessity**: Confirm the account truly needs permanent removal
2. **Export important data**: Save any information you might need later
3. **Notify stakeholders**: Inform team members who work with this account
4. **Check for dependencies**: Review if other accounts or systems depend on this account
5. **Document reason**: Record why the account is being deleted

### Account Deletion Process

To delete a single account:

2. **Locate the target account** using search or filters
3. **Click on the account name** to open account details
4. Click `Edit Account`
5. **Scroll to the bottom** of the edit form

7. **Read the deletion warning** carefully
8. **Type confirmation text** if required (often the business name)
9. Click `Delete Account` and confirm the action

## How to Handle Account Deletion Requests

### Customer-Requested Deletions

When customers request account deletion:

1. **Understand the reason** for deletion request
2. **Explain alternatives** such as account deactivation or service pause
3. **Review contract terms** regarding data retention and deletion
4. **Obtain written confirmation** of deletion request
5. **Set appropriate timeline** for deletion (consider notice periods)
6. **Complete data export** if customer requests their data
7. **Execute deletion** following internal procedures

### Internal Deletion Decisions

For business-initiated deletions:

1. **Document business justification** for deletion
2. **Get appropriate approvals** from management
3. **Review legal and compliance** requirements
4. **Plan for data retention** if required by regulations
5. **Communicate with affected teams** before deletion
6. **Execute deletion** during appropriate maintenance windows

## Alternatives to Account Deletion

### Account Deactivation

Instead of deletion, consider deactivation:

**Benefits of deactivation:**
- Preserves historical data for reporting
- Allows reactivation if circumstances change
- Maintains compliance with data retention requirements
- Reduces risk of accidental data loss

**How to deactivate accounts:**
1. Edit the account settings
2. Change account status to "Inactive" or "Deactivated"
3. Remove active products and services
4. Disable user access
5. Remove from active account lists

### Account Archiving

For long-term inactive accounts:

1. **Move accounts to archive lists**
2. **Remove from active workflows**
3. **Maintain basic account information**
4. **Preserve reporting data**
5. **Document archive reason and date**

### Service Suspension

For temporary issues:

1. **Pause active services** without deleting data
2. **Suspend user access** temporarily
3. **Maintain account structure** for easy reactivation
4. **Set suspension duration** and review dates

## How to Manage Duplicate Account Cleanup

### Identifying Duplicate Accounts

Common signs of duplicate accounts:
- Similar business names with slight variations
- Same address but different business names
- Identical phone numbers or contact information
- Same business owner with multiple account variations

### Duplicate Resolution Process

1. **Identify the primary account** with the most complete information
2. **Export data from duplicate accounts** before deletion
3. **Merge important information** into the primary account
4. **Transfer any active users** to the primary account
5. **Move product history** and important notes
6. **Delete duplicate accounts** after data consolidation

### Preventing Future Duplicates

- Implement thorough search procedures during account creation
- Train team members on duplicate detection
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Regular data audits to identify potential duplicates

## Data Recovery and Backup Considerations

### Pre-Deletion Data Backup

Before deleting important accounts:

1. **Export complete account data** including contact information and settings
2. **Save user lists and access information**
3. **Download important files and documents**
4. **Export reporting data** for historical records
5. **Document product configurations** for reference

### Recovery Limitations

After account deletion:
- Data cannot be recovered from the system
- User access cannot be restored
- Product history is permanently lost
- Integration connections must be recreated

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Can I recover an account after deletion?</summary>

No, account deletion is permanent and irreversible. Once deleted, all account data is permanently removed from the system and cannot be recovered.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between deleting and deactivating an account?</summary>

Deletion permanently removes all account data, while deactivation preserves the account data but makes it inactive. Deactivated accounts can be reactivated later if needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long should I wait before deleting an inactive account?</summary>

This depends on your business policies and legal requirements. Many organizations wait 6-12 months after service termination before considering deletion, allowing time for potential reactivation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens to user access when I delete an account?</summary>

All user access is immediately revoked when an account is deleted. Users will no longer be able to log into their Business App dashboard or access any account-related services.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I delete accounts for businesses that have closed?</summary>

Consider business closure type: temporary closures might warrant deactivation, while permanent closures after appropriate waiting periods might justify deletion. Always check legal and compliance requirements first.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I bulk delete multiple accounts at once?</summary>

Most systems don't support bulk deletion due to the permanent nature of the action. Each account typically requires individual deletion confirmation to prevent accidental mass deletions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do with accounts that have outstanding billing issues?</summary>

Resolve billing matters before account deletion. Deletion may complicate billing disputes or collections processes. Deactivation might be more appropriate until financial matters are resolved.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I handle deletion requests from former employees?</summary>

Only current authorized users or account administrators should be able to request account deletions. Verify authorization and follow your organization's approval procedures for deletion requests.
