### Search Best Practices

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>

Check for typos in search terms, try partial names instead of full business names, verify the account wasn't accidentally filtered out by previous filter settings, and ensure you have permission to view the accounts.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I search for accounts by customer phone numbers?</summary>

Yes, enter phone numbers in various formats in the search bar. The system recognizes different phone number formats and will find matching accounts.

</details>
