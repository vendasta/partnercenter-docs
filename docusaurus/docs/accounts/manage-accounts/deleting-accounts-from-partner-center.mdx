## How deletion affects your Vendasta usage reports

When an account is deleted, it will impact your usage metrics:

- The account will no longer appear in your active accounts count
- Any products or services the account was using will be removed from your usage totals
- Historical data for the account may still appear in reports with a "deleted" status

*Note: For detailed information about estimated usage, please refer to Vendasta's documentation on usage tracking.*

## Finding deleted accounts

If you need to reference previously deleted accounts, you can check your account history logs. These logs maintain a record of account creation and deletion events for compliance and auditing purposes.
