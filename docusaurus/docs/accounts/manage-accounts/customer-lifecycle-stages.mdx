# Customer Lifecycle Stages

![Customer Lifecycle Stages Header](./img/accounts/lifecycle_stages_header.jpg)

Customer Lifecycle Stages allow you to quickly identify where a customer is in their journey with you. Each stage represents a different phase of the customer relationship, from initial lead to long-term client, helping your team prioritize action and provide the right level of engagement at the right time.

## What are Customer Lifecycle Stages used for?

![Customer Lifecycle Uses](./img/accounts/lifecycle_uses.jpg)

Lifecycle stages are powerful tools that help your team:

- **Track customer progression** through their journey with your business
- **Segment your customers** for targeted communications and campaigns
- **Focus your team's attention** on accounts that need specific types of engagement
- **Automate workflows** based on a customer's current stage
- **Measure conversion rates** between stages to identify opportunities for improvement

## How Customer Lifecycle Stages Work

The customer lifecycle in Vendasta follows a natural progression from new leads to established customers:

1. **Lead**: A potential customer who has shown interest but hasn't yet purchased
2. **Opportunity**: A qualified lead actively considering your solutions
3. **Customer**: An active client currently using your products or services
4. **At Risk**: A customer showing signs of possible churn
5. **Churned**: A former customer who has stopped their business relationship

Each stage helps your team quickly understand what type of engagement is appropriate for different accounts.

## Manually Changing a Customer's Lifecycle Stage

## Automating Lifecycle Stage Changes

For more efficiency, you can set up automation rules that change lifecycle stages based on specific triggers or conditions.

3. Set the trigger conditions (e.g., "When a customer purchases a product")
4. Choose "Update Lifecycle Stage" as the action
5. Select which stage the customer should move to
6. Save your automation rule

## Best Practices for Customer Lifecycle Stages

- **Regularly review** your customers' lifecycle stages to ensure accuracy
- **Train your team** on what each stage means and what actions are appropriate
- **Use consistent criteria** for moving customers between stages
- **Integrate lifecycle stages** with your marketing and sales processes
- **Analyze progression patterns** to identify bottlenecks in your customer journey

By effectively utilizing customer lifecycle stages, you can improve customer retention, optimize resource allocation, and create more personalized experiences throughout the customer journey.
