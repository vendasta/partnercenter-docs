## How to Handle Account Creation Issues

### Business Not Found in Search

**Common causes and solutions:**

**Business name variations:**
- Try shortened names or common abbreviations
- Search without business type suffixes (e.g., "LLC", "Inc.")
- Use owner or manager names if business name is unclear

**New or unlisted businesses:**
- Use manual account creation process
- Verify business information directly with customer
- Check for recent name changes or rebranding

**Address-related issues:**
- Try searching by address instead of business name
- Verify current address with mapping services
- Check for recent relocations or closures

### Import Error Resolution

**Data validation errors:**
- **Missing required fields**: Complete all required columns in CSV
- **Invalid phone formats**: Use consistent formatting (e.g., (555) 123-4567)
- **Address validation failures**: Verify addresses exist and are properly formatted
- **Category assignment errors**: Use exact category names from the system

**Duplicate business handling:**
- **Similar names**: Review carefully for legitimate duplicates vs. similar businesses
- **Same addresses**: Check for businesses sharing locations (like shopping centers)
- **Phone number conflicts**: Verify which business currently uses the number

### Best Practices for Account Creation

**Data Quality:**
- Always verify business information before creating accounts
- Use official business names as they appear in legal documents
- Include complete address information for location-based services
- Select the most specific business categories available

**Organization:**
- Use consistent naming conventions for similar businesses
- Apply relevant tags immediately after creation
- Assign appropriate markets based on service territories
- Plan for future list organization and grouping

**Customer Communication:**
- Prepare welcome materials for new account holders
