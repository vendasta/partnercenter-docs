Sometimes, you may find it necessary to restrict a Business App user's access to certain accounts or features. You may wish to do so for the following reasons:

- A regional manager should only see the stores they manage.
- A website developer should only have access to website products and not other aspects of the company's business.
- A single business owner needs to only see their account.

## Configuring User Permissions

### Method 1:

1. From **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Users**, find the user you wish to edit permissions for.
   - This can also be accessed from **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts > *Account Name* > Users**.

2. Click ![Menu icon](./img/accounts/configure-user-permissions/4406958074391.png) **> Edit Permissions**.

- Please note that changes made here only apply to users that are already in the system.

### Method 2:

To enable/disable any tab in the Business App for *all users* - both existing and subsequently new users, navigate to Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Business App > Customize Business App 

OR

Partner Center > Administration > Customize Business App > From each of the page tabs, you can check the 'show this page' box to either enable or disable the page from Business App for **all users**.
