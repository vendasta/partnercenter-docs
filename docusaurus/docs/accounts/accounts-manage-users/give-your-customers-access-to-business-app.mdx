To allow your customers to log in and experience their new products in, you'll need to get them set up with login credentials.

When is the right time to give them access? **As soon as possible!**

Business App is built to support businesses out of the box, meaning they'll have access to reporting, your product catalog, and in-depth guides as soon as they've logged in.

1. Navigate to **Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts >** Select the account you would like to add the user to.

## Resend a welcome email

Your customers may already have access to Business Appâ€”they can gain access when they click on a call-to-action in the Snapshot Report. If this is the case, you have the option to resend the welcome email. This allows your customers to reset their passwords and then log in to Business App.

To resend a welcome email:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Accounts** > [**Manage Users**](https://partners.vendasta.com/bc-admin/).
2. Find the user that should receive the welcome email. Click on the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](/img/accounts/accounts-manage-users/menu-icon.png) to the right of the user.
