# Accounts Overview

## What are Accounts?

In Business App, an "account" represents an individual business location or customer that you serve. Accounts are the foundation of your Business App workspace, containing all the essential information about each business including their profile, users, active products, and settings.

Each account serves as a complete business profile that includes:
- Business information (name, address, contact details, categories)
- User access and permissions
- Active products and services
- Reporting and analytics data
- Custom settings and preferences

## Why is Account Management Important?

Effective account management is crucial for several reasons:

- **Centralized Organization**: Keep all customer information organized in one location for easy access and management
