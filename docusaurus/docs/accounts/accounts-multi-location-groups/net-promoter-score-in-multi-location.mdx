## How Net Promoter Score is Calculated

NPS is determined using the following formula:

**NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors**

- **Promoters (9-10):** Customers who would recommend your brand.
- **Passives (7-8):** Neutral customers who are satisfied but not enthusiastic.
- **Detractors (0-6):** Customers who would not recommend your brand.
