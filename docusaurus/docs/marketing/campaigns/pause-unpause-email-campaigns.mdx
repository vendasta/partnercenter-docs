# Pause and unpause email campaigns

Email marketing campaigns can be paused or unpaused from Partner Center.

:::note
Currently, pausing and then unpausing a campaign will not preserve buffering recipients. Pausing a campaign will move all recipients to Stopped, including those that were buffering before the campaign was paused. Unpausing a campaign will move all Stopped recipients to In Progress, including those that had been buffering before the campaign was paused.

When a campaign is paused, all preset email drip timing will be reset. For example, if a campaign is paused, each recipient will be reset to wait the full duration between the step they last received and the next step they should receive.
:::

To pause/unpause an email campaign:

1. Go to **Partner Center** > **Marketing > Campaigns.**
2. Search for the campaign you want to pause. Click the **three dots** ![Three dots icon](./img/marketing/marketing-campaigns/three-dots-icon.png) at the end of the campaign row.
3. Click **Pause Campaign** or **Resume Campaign**.

:::note
You can also pause/unpause the campaign from the campaign page. Click **Actions** in the upper right corner of the screen, then click **Pause Campaign** or **Resume Campaign**.

## Issues with unpausing email campaigns

If a campaign will not unpause, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. Account(s) on the campaign is missing a Snapshot Report when a Snapshot is required for the campaign. Retry after ensuring that all accounts have a Snapshot Report. 
2. Account(s) on the campaign are missing a specific product or add-on when a specific product or add-on is required for the campaign. Retry after ensuring that the required productâ€”according to the campaign's contentâ€”is active on all accounts.
3. If the mailing address information is missing, an unsubscribe option will not be available. Check your email settings under **Partner Center** > **Administration** > **Customize** > [Email Settings](https://partners.vendasta.com/customize-design) for more details.
4. The loading deadline may have been exceeded. If this is the case, ensure that you are connected to the internet and try again.
