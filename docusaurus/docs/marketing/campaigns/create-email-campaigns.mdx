### **Preview and test your campaigns**

Email clients—such as Gmail, Apple Mail, and Outlook—display emails differently. As such, we recommend that you preview and test your emails by sending them to your own email address or, better yet, a third-party testing tool. You need to make sure everything looks great and all your links are working.

**Note:** *In order for a Test Campaign to be sent successfully there needs to be an account linked to the User receiving the email.*

To test your emails from the campaign page:

1. Click **Preview** under the first email. 

![Preview Button](./img/marketing/marketing-campaigns/preview-button.jpg)

2. Click **Send Yourself a Test Email**. 

![Send Test Email](./img/marketing/marketing-campaigns/send-test-email.png)

3. Enter the test email address, then click **Send Test**.
4. Scroll Next to the following emails, if applicable. Click **Send Test** for each email.
