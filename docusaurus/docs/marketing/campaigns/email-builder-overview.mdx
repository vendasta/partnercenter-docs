## How does it work?

### Accessing the email builder

When creating an email campaign, click "Create new email" to be taken into the email builder.

### Customize Logo

Use this feature to hide or customize the logo for each email you design in the campaign. The logo can be hidden or changed for each different email inside the drip campaigns. This will allow for more personalized content to go out.

The logo customization block will also allow adding any URLs to which the users can be directed upon clicking on the logo.

### Using content blocks

All email content is placed in content "blocks." Email Builder gives you multiple blocks that you can just click and add. The blocks determine what kind of content can be entered as well as the styling and editing options that are available to you. Click "+Add new block" to start building your email.
