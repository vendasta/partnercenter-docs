# Guide - Adding SPF, DKIM, & DMARC Records (GoDaddy)

Before proceeding with the instructions below, follow this first and then continue with this guide: [Add Domain](email-deliverability#setting-up-a-domain)

## Adding SPF Record

1. Go to your GoDaddy account
2. Navigate to your Domain section
3. Click on Manage DNS
4. Look for the DNS records management section

5. Add the following record
   - Type: **TXT**
   - Host: **@**
   - Value: **v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all**
   - TTL: **1 hour**

## Validate SPF Record

To verify that your SPF record is set up properly:

## Adding DKIM Records

1. In your DNS Records, add the below. Replace "YOUR-DOMAIN-COM" with your actual domain with "-" (hyphens) replacing the periods. For example, if your domain is "example.com", you would enter "example-com".

2. Add the following records:
   - Type: **CNAME**
   - Host: **google._domainkey**
   - Value: **google._domainkey.YOUR-DOMAIN-COM.dkim.amazonses.com.**
   - TTL: **1 hour**

   - Type: **CNAME**
   - Host: **s1._domainkey**
   - Value: **s1._domainkey.YOUR-DOMAIN-COM.dkim.amazonses.com.**
   - TTL: **1 hour**

   - Type: **CNAME**
   - Host: **s2._domainkey**
   - Value: **s2._domainkey.YOUR-DOMAIN-COM.dkim.amazonses.com.**
   - TTL: **1 hour**

## On Your Domain

Once the above is added, your GoDaddy DNS Records **must match** the image below:

## Validate DKIM

If any of the hostnames or values **do not match** the above, you will receive a **Not Found** status and emails will **NOT** be delivered effectively.

To validate the DKIM records, you need to wait up to 48 hours for the changes to take effect. After that, you can check the DKIM status in your email settings.

## Adding DMARC Record

1. In your DNS Records, add the following:
   - Type: **TXT**
   - Host: **_dmarc**
   - Value: **v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:YOUR-EMAIL-HERE@YOUR-DOMAIN.COM**
   - TTL: **1 hour**

2. Replace "YOUR-EMAIL-HERE@YOUR-DOMAIN.COM" with your actual email address that will receive DMARC reports.

## Important Notes

- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate throughout the internet
- If you're experiencing issues with email deliverability after adding these records, please wait at least 48 hours before troubleshooting further
