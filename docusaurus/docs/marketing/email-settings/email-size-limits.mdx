# Does the platform have limits to email size?

The platform has a limitation on the current email service. It can't send an email that has content exceeding **32,000** characters of HTML source code. If an email sent exceeds the limit, the error below will be displayed.

"Whoops! The character limit for this email template has exceeded the maximum of 32,000 characters. Please update the template by reducing the amount of characters used and try again."
