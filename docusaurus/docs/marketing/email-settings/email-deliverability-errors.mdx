# Email Deliverability Errors

### **Common Email Deliverability errors**

| | **Error** | **Meaning** |
|:---:|---|---|
| 1 | If your message was rejected with **listed on spamrl.com as a source of spam** | This means we have seen multiple (verified) spam emails originating from your IP(s). |
| 2 | If your message was rejected with **listed on spamrl.com as a source of viruses** | This means we have seen multiple (automatically classified) virus emails originating from your IP(s) |
| 3 | If your message was rejected with **listed on spamrl.com as a source of phishing** | This means we have seen multiple (verified) phishing emails originating from your IP(s). OR large amounts of failing auth (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) reports. |
| 4 | If your message was rejected with **listed on spamrl.com as a source of dictionary attacks** | This means we have been seeing significant traffic to non-existing mailboxes originating from your IP(s), compared to legitimate deliveries. This is automated, and NOT caused by spam reports. |
| 5 | If your message was rejected with **domain IP listed on spamrl.com** | This means we have seen multiple (verified) spam/virus/phishing emails originating from your IP(s) or domain(s) OR a trusted third-party source has blacklisted your IP(s) or domain(s) and we have seen insufficient legitimate traffic or reports to ignore that third-party listing. |

### **What should I do?**

1. **[Check](http://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx)** any external blacklists, and request delisting on systems where you are listed.

2. Request for the domain or IP to be whitelisted **[here](https://spamrl.com/delist/)**.
