### **What is reCAPTCHA?**

[Google reCAPTCHA](https://google.com/recaptcha) stops spammers and bots from submitting the form.

Google's reCAPTCHA prompts visitors to check a box to prove they are human before submitting their results. Sometimes, they are prompted to complete another task (e.g, identifying a series of letters). reCAPTCHA makes it difficult for bots to automate form submissions.

### **How to get the Site Key and Secret Key**

**Step 1:** Go to [https://google.com/recaptcha/admin/create](https://google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)

**Step 2**: In your Google reCAPTCHA admin panel, you should see the 'Register a new site' screen by default (if you already have reCAPTCHA site(s) set up, click on the Create icon (+) on the top-right).

- **Label:** Enter the name of your site
- **reCAPTCHA type:** Choose "reCAPTCHA v3"
- **Domains:** Add the domain(s) that you intend to put the form on
- **Accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service**: Make sure to accept the terms and mark the checkbox, then click Submit.

**Step 4:** Make sure to test your embed form to ensure that you see the reCAPTCHA in place and that there are no errors that can prevent new visitors from signing up.
