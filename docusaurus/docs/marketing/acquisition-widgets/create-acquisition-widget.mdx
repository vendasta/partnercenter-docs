Tip: Create dedicated landing pages for the Acquisition Widget and link to it from advertising campaigns, social posts, blog posts, and email signatures.
When a lead submits their information through the widget, the widget will notify the assigned salespeople so they can get in touch with the lead ASAP. Simultaneously, a new Snapshot Report will be created, the lead will be added to the customer acquisition campaign of your choice, and/or products will be activated, depending on your configuration.
