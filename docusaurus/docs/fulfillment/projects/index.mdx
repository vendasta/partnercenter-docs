# Projects

## What are Projects?

Projects in the fulfillment system help you organize, track, and communicate about your work with team members and clients. You can manage all aspects of project delivery from a central workspace, including task assignment, client communication, progress tracking, and reporting.

## Why are Projects important?

Projects and their tasks can have many moving parts and involved parties, making context valuable when making fulfillment decisions. By keeping all communication in one place and within view of the task at hand, context remains easily accessible and hard to miss.

Projects deliver a more cohesive experience for your clients, with all communication visible in real-time within their main Inbox portal in Business App. You can respond quickly and easily to questions or comments to keep project progress moving forward efficiently.

## What's Included with Projects?

### Project Communications
Collaborate with teammates and communicate with clients directly within the project workspace. All communication stays organized around specific tasks and projects.

### Notifications and Updates
Stay informed about project updates, status changes, and important milestones. Automatic email notifications keep all parties informed when key events occur.

### Executive Reporting
Track project progress and generate reports for stakeholders. Project updates appear in Executive Report to showcase work completed during selected time periods.

### Task Management
Organize and assign tasks within projects to ensure timely completion. Tasks can be made visible to clients and configured for approval workflows.

## How to Set Up Project Communications

1. Go to **Task Manager**
2. Open a project or task (the task must be associated with the project)
3. Add a comment in the **Comments** tab
4. Use "@" to tag another user in your comment
5. To make comments visible to the client, switch on the **Public** toggle

### Client Approval Settings

When a task and project are visible in Task Manager, you can open a task and check the box to allow Business App users to approve and provide feedback on that task in Business App.

## How Project Notifications Work

The Business App User or Digital Agent User will receive an email notification with comments or status updates in these situations:

- When the order begins
- When the status changes to waiting on customer
- When the due date is changed
- When comments are added to public tasks

### Notification Workflow

- **Business App Users** can review comments and provide feedback, or approve tasks within Business App by navigating to **My Business > Projects**
- **Digital Agent Users** can review and respond to comments within the Project Task in Task Manager
- You can notify relevant parties without a comment when you change the due date, add a collaborator, or change the status to waiting on customer

## Project Updates in Executive Report

Executive Report showcases work done on projects in Task Manager through the project updates card. This feature supplements the fulfillment projects card by providing detailed visibility into project activities.

### What Appears in Executive Report

The project updates card allows business owners to see exactly what is happening with projects. It showcases each update made during the selected time period and includes badges to indicate what types of updates have been made.

### Requirements for Executive Report Display

Any projects and tasks that have been set to 'visible in Business App' will show in Executive Report, provided an update was made during the selected time period.
