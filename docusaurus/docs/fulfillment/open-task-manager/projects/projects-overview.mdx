## What are Projects in Task Manager?

Projects in Task Manager help you organize related tasks, assign team members, and track progress for client work. You can create custom projects or use Social Calendar projects for social media management, set deadlines, and share progress with clients through Business App.

- Organize related tasks under a single project umbrella
- Assign team members and track individual responsibilities

- Automate project creation when products are activated
- Create reusable templates for common workflows

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>How can I make projects visible in the Executive Report?</summary>
