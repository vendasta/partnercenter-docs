# Task Communication and Collaboration

## What is Task Communication and Collaboration?

Task communication and collaboration features enable effective teamwork and client interaction through tasks. These tools include rich text formatting, user tagging, public notes for clients, approval workflows, and bulk editing capabilities.

## Why is Communication Important in Tasks?

Effective task communication helps you:

- **Improve Teamwork**: Keep team members informed and engaged
- **Enhance Client Relations**: Share appropriate information with clients
- **Streamline Workflows**: Reduce emails and external communication
- **Maintain Accountability**: Track decisions and approvals within tasks
- **Scale Operations**: Manage communication efficiently across multiple tasks

## How to Use Rich Text in Task Notes

### Rich Text Formatting Options

You can format task notes and project descriptions using:
- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- Hyperlinks to relevant resources

This helps emphasize important information and keeps all relevant details organized within tasks.

### Best Practices for Rich Text

- **Bold** for critical information or deadlines
- *Italics* for optional or supplementary details
- **Hyperlinks** for relevant documentation, resources, or external sites
- Keep formatting consistent across your team

## How to Use Public vs Private Notes

### Public Notes in Business App

Public notes on tasks visible to Business App users will appear in the client's Business App interface under Projects. This improves client communication and gives you control over shared information.

Public notes then appear in Business App:

### When to Use Public Notes
- Project status updates
- Next steps for clients
- Required client actions
- General progress information

### When to Use Private Notes
- Internal team discussions
- Sensitive client information
- Technical details
- Strategy discussions

:::warning
If you have public notes you don't wish to share, move them to private notes before making tasks visible to clients.

### Comment Notifications

When tagged, users receive:

- **Email notice** containing the comment content (unless disabled in their notification settings)

### Best Practices for User Tagging

- Tag relevant team members for input or action
- Use clear, specific messages when tagging
- Don't over-tag - only include necessary people
- Follow up on tags to ensure action is taken

## How to Use Bulk Editing for Collaboration

Bulk editing allows you to quickly update multiple tasks simultaneously, improving team efficiency and consistency.

### Prerequisites for Bulk Editing

Before bulk editing tasks, ensure you have:

1. **Account User Manager Role**: Permission to manage users and access levels
2. **Team Member with Admin Access**: Administrative permissions for the accounts
3. **Manager Role**: Users must be set up as Manager in their profile to complete bulk actions

### Setting Up Manager Role
1. Navigate to `Partner Center` > `Fulfillment` > `Users` > `Manage Users`
2. Click on the menu and `Edit User`
3. Select `Manager`

#### 1. Select Tasks
- Navigate to the Tasks section

- Use filters to narrow down tasks before selecting

![Select Tasks to Edit](./img/bulk-edit-tasks/select-tasks.jpg)

#### 2. Apply Edits
- Click the `Edit` button at the top of the task list
- Choose fields to update (status, assignee, due date)

- Click `Save` to apply changes to all selected tasks

#### 3. Review Changes
Verify that edits were applied correctly and communicate changes to affected team members.

### Bulk Editing Best Practices

- **Filter First**: Use filters to narrow down your selection before bulk editing
- **Double-Check Selection**: Verify you've selected only the tasks you want to edit
- **Communicate Changes**: Inform affected team members about bulk changes
- **Use Regularly**: Implement bulk editing as part of regular task maintenance

:::warning
**Bulk Editing Limitations:**
- Some task fields may not be available for bulk editing
- You cannot edit tasks from different accounts simultaneously
- Custom fields may have specific requirements or limitations
