# Tasks Overview

## What are Tasks?

Tasks are the backbone of Task Manager that allow you to view and track the work you need to fulfill. They provide easy access to the tools necessary to complete various fulfillment activities for your clients. Tasks can be created manually or generated automatically based on specific triggers and account settings.

## Why are Tasks Important?

Tasks streamline your fulfillment workflow by:

- **Organizing Work**: Providing a centralized location to track all client-related activities
- **Improving Efficiency**: Enabling bulk operations and automated task generation
- **Enhancing Communication**: Supporting rich text notes, user tagging, and approval workflows
- **Maintaining Accountability**: Tracking due dates, assignments, and completion status
- **Scaling Operations**: Using templates and automation to handle increasing workloads

Task Manager provides comprehensive task management capabilities including:

- **Manual Task Creation**: Create custom tasks for any account or project
- **Auto-Generated Tasks**: Automatically create tasks based on account activity
- **Bulk Operations**: Edit multiple tasks simultaneously to save time
- **Enhanced Search**: Find tasks using keywords, account names, contacts, addresses, order IDs, and tags
- **Flexible Sorting**: Organize tasks by multiple criteria including due date, status, and creation date
- **Rich Text Support**: Format notes with bold, italics, and hyperlinks
- **User Tagging**: Mention team members in comments to improve communication

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Why are my reviews disappearing when I filter by multiple star ratings?</summary>

The star rating filters use "AND" logic instead of "OR" logic. When you select multiple star ratings, the system looks for reviews that match ALL selected criteria simultaneously (1-star AND 2-star AND 3-star), which is impossible. Select one star rating at a time for filtering. You can still combine star rating filters with task status and assignee filters.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do auto-generated tasks work?</summary>

Auto-generated tasks are created automatically based on account activity and your configured settings. For example, when new reviews are posted, new mentions appear online, or questions are asked on Google Business Profile, tasks will generate automatically if those task types are enabled for the account.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between public and private notes?</summary>

Public notes on tasks visible to Business App users will appear in the client's interface under Projects. Private notes remain internal to your team. If you have sensitive information, keep it in private notes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I search for tasks using partial information?</summary>

Yes, the enhanced search functionality allows you to search using partial matches for names, accounts, contacts, addresses, order IDs, and tags. Use quotation marks for exact phrase matches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I organize tasks by priority or urgency?</summary>

Use tags to create your own priority system (e.g., "urgent", "high-priority", "low-priority") and combine this with sorting by due date. You can also use the bulk edit feature to quickly update multiple tasks with priority tags.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do if I can't find a specific task?</summary>

Use the enhanced search feature to search by account name, contact, address, order ID, or tags. You can also apply filters by status, assignee, or task type, then sort results by creation date, due date, or other criteria to locate the task.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I ensure clients see important task updates?</summary>

Use public notes for information you want clients to see, set tasks to visible in Business App, and use the "Waiting on Customer" status with notifications when client input is needed. Rich text formatting can help emphasize important information in public notes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I manage tasks for multi-location businesses?</summary>

Use tags to organize tasks by location, and leverage the enhanced search to find tasks by address or location-specific keywords. You can also use bulk editing to apply changes across multiple location-related tasks efficiently.
