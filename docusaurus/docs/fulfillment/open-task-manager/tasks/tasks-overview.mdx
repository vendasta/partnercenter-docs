## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Why are my reviews disappearing when I filter by multiple star ratings?</summary>

The star rating filters use "AND" logic instead of "OR" logic. When you select multiple star ratings, the system looks for reviews that match ALL selected criteria simultaneously (1-star AND 2-star AND 3-star), which is impossible. Select one star rating at a time for filtering. You can still combine star rating filters with task status and assignee filters.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What permissions do I need to bulk edit tasks?</summary>

You need three things: Account User Manager role, Team Member with Admin Access for the relevant accounts, and Manager role in your user profile. Without the Manager role, you cannot complete bulk actions in Task Manager.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I edit tasks from different accounts at the same time?</summary>

No, you cannot bulk edit tasks from different accounts simultaneously. You can only bulk edit tasks within the same account at one time.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do auto-generated tasks work?</summary>

Auto-generated tasks are created automatically based on account activity and your configured settings. For example, when new reviews are posted, new mentions appear online, or questions are asked on Google Business Profile, tasks will generate automatically if those task types are enabled for the account.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when I tag someone in a task comment?</summary>

Tagged users receive both an in-app notification and an email notice (unless they've disabled notifications). The in-app notification includes a direct link to the task, and the email contains the comment content.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use rich text formatting in all task notes?</summary>

Yes, you can use bold, italics, and hyperlinks in both task notes and project descriptions. This helps emphasize important information and organize content effectively.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I turn off auto-generated tasks for specific accounts?</summary>

Go to Open Task Manager > Accounts, select the account, click Account Settings, navigate to Task generation, and toggle the specific task types off. You can control this for individual accounts or set defaults for all new accounts in Settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between public and private notes?</summary>

Public notes on tasks visible to Business App users will appear in the client's interface under Projects. Private notes remain internal to your team. If you have sensitive information, keep it in private notes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I search for tasks using partial information?</summary>

Yes, the enhanced search functionality allows you to search using partial matches for names, accounts, contacts, addresses, order IDs, and tags. Use quotation marks for exact phrase matches.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I organize tasks by priority or urgency?</summary>

Use tags to create your own priority system (e.g., "urgent", "high-priority", "low-priority") and combine this with sorting by due date. You can also use the bulk edit feature to quickly update multiple tasks with priority tags.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when I request approval for a review response?</summary>

The approval request email is sent to all Business App users and notification recipients on that account who have Review Response Approval enabled. Task Manager records the time in a public note and changes the task status to "Waiting on Customer."

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I create custom task templates?</summary>

While the documents don't detail custom task creation templates, you can create review response templates for different star ratings and business categories. For other custom tasks, you'll need to create them manually or use the auto-generation features for standard task types.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I manage tasks for multi-location businesses?</summary>

Use tags to organize tasks by location, and leverage the enhanced search to find tasks by address or location-specific keywords. You can also use bulk editing to apply changes across multiple location-related tasks efficiently.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What should I do if I can't find a specific task?</summary>

Use the enhanced search feature to search by account name, contact, address, order ID, or tags. You can also apply filters by status, assignee, or task type, then sort results by creation date, due date, or other criteria to locate the task.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I ensure clients see important task updates?</summary>

Use public notes for information you want clients to see, set tasks to visible in Business App, and use the "Waiting on Customer" status with notifications when client input is needed. Rich text formatting can help emphasize important information in public notes.
