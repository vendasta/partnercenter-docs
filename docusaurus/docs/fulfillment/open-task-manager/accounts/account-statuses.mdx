---

In Task Manager, there are three types of account statuses. These help you keep track of the accounts you're doing work for.

- **Active** - An account that you are currently working with. The [selected task types](/fulfillment/open-task-manager/tasks/task-types) will automatically generate when there is relevant work.
- **Paused** - An account you have temporarily stopped working with *or* one that you temporarily don't want tasks to auto-generate for.
- **Deactivated** - An account you have deactivated temporarily for business. You may wish to bring it back to active at some point in time.

:::note
**Note:** By default, accounts are added as active. This can be changed in **Settings > Account settings**.
