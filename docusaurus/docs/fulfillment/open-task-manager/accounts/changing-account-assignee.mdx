All accounts in Task Manager have an assignee. Account assignees are commonly designated to determine who the primary point of contact is or who is managing the fulfillment of the Account. Once an account has an assignee, you can use Filters to find all accounts associated with an assignee.

- A visual indicator to other agents of who the primary point of contact is
- Tracking how many accounts an assignee manages at once to balance team workloads
