It can be hard to know where to start when fulfilling for clients. If you're offering a new service or looking for tips on how to handle existing services, the template library is here to help.

We've pre-made templates you might want to use for your own agency. These can be customized when adding to your collection of templates, allowing you to make sure they match your workflow.

### **Why is the template library important?**

There are some key benefits to using the template library:

- You'll have a clearer idea of what goes into setting up a project if you haven't done so before
- You don't need to worry about starting from scratch, instead just tweak an existing template to add to your own collection

### **How to use the template library**

The template library can be accessed when adding new templates:

1. **Open Task Manager**
2. Go to the **Templates** tab
3. Click **Create Template > Select from the library**
4. To start, you'll need to choose your base template. If you're not sure what to go with, we recommend **Generic** as it's designed to give you a solid basis to make projects that best suit your needs.
5. Once you've clicked **View** for the template you're interested in, you'll see the tasks it comes with. Feel free to adjust the template to fit your needs for a particular project.

Please note that any changes you make to the template will only apply to the project you are creating. The template itself won't be altered. Should you wish to save your changes for future projects, we recommend using the **project** option.
