# Fulfillment User Groups

## What are fulfillment user groups and why should you use them?

As companies grow, there's an increased need for structure. People begin to specialize, teams form, and work is divided. Most larger agencies feature complex hierarchies of people. To manage it all and ensure the right person does the right job, it's important that your task management software matches the way your organization works in the real world.

In Task Manager, this is accomplished via **Groups**. Groups have two primary purposes:

1. Managers can structure their staff just like they do in real life.
2. Managers can filter the **Tasks > Overview** page in Partner Center by group.

## What makes up a group?

Groups can contain Task Manager users and other groups. The relationship isn't one-to-one either, so you can add each user and group to as many groups as you'd like. Take the following example:

Everyone in **Group 1** and **Group 2** will be part of **Group 3**. This is because **Group 3** contains both of the other groups.

If you were to remove **Sam Brady** from **Group 3**, they would still belong to that group since they are part of **Group 1**.

To create a new Group in Partner Center, navigate to the **Tasks** tab > **Users** > click on **Create Group** > enter the details for the group > click **Create Group**.

## How to create a User Group

1. Go to Partner Center > Fulfillment > **Users.**
2. Click **Create group.**
3. **Name** the group.
4. *Optional â€“* **Add users** and **other groups.**
5. Click **'Create group.**
