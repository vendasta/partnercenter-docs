If you need to remove a user or group from an existing group, you can do so from Partner Center.

### **How to remove users or groups from existing groups**

1. Go to **Partner Center > Fulfillment > Users.**
2. Click **Groups.**
3. Click on the **menu (3 dots) > Edit group** next to the group you wish to edit OR
4. To delete a Group, click on the **menu (3 dots) > Delete group**
5. **Delete group** to remove the group.

:::note
If a user is part of a group in the **Groups** field, that user will continue to be part of the group you are editing. To ensure they are fully removed, you'll need to also remove them from any other listed groups they are a part of.
