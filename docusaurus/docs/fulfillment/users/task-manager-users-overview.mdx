# Task Manager Users – Complete Overview

## What is Task Manager User Management?

Task Manager user management allows you to create, organize, and manage team members who will collaborate on projects and tasks. The system includes user creation, group organization, notification management, and permission control to structure your fulfillment team effectively.

## Why is Task Manager User Management important?

As companies grow, there's an increased need for structure. People begin to specialize, teams form, and work is divided. Most larger agencies feature complex hierarchies of people. Task Manager user management ensures the right person does the right job by matching your task management software to how your organization works in the real world.

Task Manager works best when your team uses it together. You can see the projects and tasks assigned to each other, track responsibilities, and automatically assign specific tasks to certain team members.

## What's Included with Task Manager User Management?

### User Creation and Management
- Create new Task Manager users with specific roles
- Assign Digital Agent or Manager permissions
- Send welcome emails to new users
- Update existing user permissions

### User Groups
- Create groups containing Task Manager users and other groups
- Structure staff hierarchies that match real-world organization
- Filter the `Tasks > Overview` page by group
- Add users and groups to multiple groups (many-to-many relationships)

### Notification System
- In-app notifications and email alerts for task assignments
- Customizable notification preferences for each user
- Specialized notifications like "Product Deactivated" and "Tasks Due Tomorrow"
- Direct links from notifications to specific tasks

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions (Digital Agent vs Manager)
- Manager-specific capabilities (delete tasks, bulk reassign, manage groups)
- Client access restrictions (clients cannot access Task Manager)

## How to Create Task Manager Users

1. Go to `Partner Center` > `Fulfillment` > `Users`
2. Click `Invite Team Member` OR search for an existing user to update permissions
3. **Option 1: Invite New Team Member**
   - Enter their `First name`, `Last name`, and `Email`
   - Choose their `Role` as Digital Agent
   - Optional: Make the user a manager (Managers can delete, bulk reassign tasks, and manage Task Manager groups)
   - Optional: Send Welcome Email to User
4. **Option 2: Update Existing User**
   - Search for an existing user
   - Edit Team Member Permissions to Digital Agent/Manager

## How to Create and Manage User Groups

### Creating User Groups

1. Go to `Partner Center` > `Fulfillment` > `Users`
2. Click `Create group`
3. Name the group
4. Optional: Add users and other groups
5. Click `Create group`

### Understanding Group Structure

Groups can contain Task Manager users and other groups. The relationship isn't one-to-one, so you can add each user and group to as many groups as you'd like.

![Group structure example](./img/fulfillment-users/group-structure.png)

If Group 3 contains both Group 1 and Group 2, then everyone in Group 1 and Group 2 will automatically be part of Group 3. If you remove a user directly from Group 3, they would still belong to that group if they are part of Group 1 or Group 2.

### Adding Users to Existing Groups

1. Go to `Partner Center` > `Fulfillment` > `Users`
2. Click `Groups`
3. Click on the `menu (3 dots)` > `Edit group` next to the group you wish to modify
4. Click on the `Users` fields to add or remove users or groups
5. Click `Edit group`

### Editing or Deleting Groups

1. Go to `Partner Center` > `Fulfillment` > `Users`
2. Click `Groups`
3. Click on the `menu (3 dots)` next to the group you wish to modify
4. Choose `Edit group` to modify or `Delete group` to remove
5. To delete: Click `Delete group` to confirm removal

:::warning
If a user is part of a group in the Groups field, that user will continue to be part of the group you are editing. To ensure they are fully removed, you'll need to also remove them from any other listed groups they are a part of.

### Key Notification Types

**Essential Fulfillment Notifications:**
- **Product Deactivated**: Get notified when a product associated with a project is deactivated. This helps agents decide whether to continue working on a project
- **Tasks Due Tomorrow**: When tasks are within 24 hours of their due date, the agent is notified

**Task Assignment Notifications:**
- **Task Assignee Update**: Get notified when a task is assigned to you
- **Task Manager Tagging Notification**: Get notified when you're tagged on a task
- **Task Dependency Update**: Get notified when a dependent task is unlocked

**Client Interaction Notifications:**
- **Task Manager Visible Task Approval notification**: Get notified when a client approves a task from the project tracker
- **Task Manager Visible Task Feedback notification**: Get notified when a client provides feedback on a visible task
- **Task waiting for your input**: Be notified when there is a task waiting for your input

### Managing System-Wide Notification Settings

Both Product Deactivated and Tasks Due Tomorrow notifications are enabled by default. Any user can change their notification settings:

1. Log in to `Partner Center`
2. Click ![Notification icon](./img/fulfillment-users/notification_icon.jpg) > ![Settings icon](./img/fulfillment-users/settings_icon.jpg)
3. Uncheck both notifications (email and in-app) under `Task`
4. Click `Save`

## Understanding Client Access Restrictions

**Clients do not have access to Task Manager.** Task Manager is a project management tool built for fulfillment agents and other internal teams. If you were to add a client as a Task Manager user, they would be able to see all accounts, not just their own. They would also be able to see private notes and adjust global task settings.

However, it is possible for clients to see updates on their fulfillment projects in Business App.
