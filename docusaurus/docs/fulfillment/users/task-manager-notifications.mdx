Task Manager users will receive in-app notifications and emails when they are assigned a task or project. This can occur if a new task or project is created, or when an existing one is reassigned. Notifications can be created for all events, or only events that directly involve a User.

Should a user click on the notification or on the link within the email they receive, they will be brought directly to the task in Task Manager.

## How to adjust task manager user notifications

Task Manager users can adjust their notification settings directly within Task Manager.
