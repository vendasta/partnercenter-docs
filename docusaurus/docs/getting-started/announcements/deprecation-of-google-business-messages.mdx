# Deprecation of Google Business Messages

Please be aware of an important change coming to Google this summer: Google is removing Google Business Messages from its suite of products. Starting July 31st, it will no longer be possible to respond to customers on Google Search or Maps via Inbox. Don't worryâ€”Inbox supports several other messaging integrations and solutions, including AI web chat and Forms for your website, SMS, email, and Facebook. So while you'll need to say goodbye to Google Business Messages, you and your clients will still be saying hello to lots of new leads and customers with Inbox.
