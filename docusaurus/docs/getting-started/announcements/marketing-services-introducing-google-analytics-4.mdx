# Marketing Services: Introducing Google Analytics 4: Migration and Google Analytics 4: Complete Build

### What is Google Analytics 4?

Google Analytics 4 or GA4 is replacing the well-known Universal Analytics starting July 1, 2023. This means that data will no longer be processed or tracked in Universal Analytics come July 1. Google Analytics tracks and reports website traffic and conversions to help businesses better understand their customers and their campaign success. [Here's a short article from Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en), if you're interested in learning more.

GA4 is designed to align with evolving privacy regulations and user consent requirements. It provides features like enhanced data control settings, granular data retention options, and streamlined user deletion controls. This helps businesses maintain compliance with privacy regulations and build trust with their users.

### Why should I purchase this product?

Setting up Google Analytics 4 can be a time-consuming and difficult process if your client is not familiar with the platform. Digital advertising is one of the best ways for a small business to attract more customers and retain the ones they have. Google Analytics 4 offers several improvements. It takes a user-centric approach, focusing on individual user journeys across devices and platforms. With simplified event tracking, GA4 allows easy measurement of custom events without complex configurations. It harnesses AI and machine learning to provide smarter insights, automatically identifying trends and anomalies in the data. GA4 provides enhanced cross-platform and app tracking, giving a unified view of user behaviour. It is future-proofed to adapt to privacy changes and offers robust data controls. The reporting and visualization capabilities are improved, with intuitive interfaces and interactive data visualization options. By using this new product, you can ensure your client's GA4 is optimized and ready for this change coming July 1, 2023.
