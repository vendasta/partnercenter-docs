# Templated Websites & Tailored Websites from Marketing Services

**Plus Major Updates to Website Support too!**

We took a combination of partner feedback, client feedback, and Vendasta internal feedback and incorporated it into a new Website offering that better addresses the specific needs of our clients with clear expectations for everyone involved.

**What is happening? How does it impact you?**

There are three major updates that you need to know about: the launch of new website services, the retirement of our old services, and a significant update to the way our Website Support service is delivered.

**1. Launching New Website Services**

After a ton of market research, Marketing Services is finally ready to introduce not one, but two new website offerings to the marketplace on July 19th, 2024! Here's what we're offering:

**Templated Websites**

[Templated Websites](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-XQC6XC2VMV3B4ZJZLD6Z6ZDXKN2VTC86) are pre-designed website layouts that offer a quick and cost-effective solution for businesses to get online efficiently. These templates are crafted by our expert designers, ensuring a professional look and feel that aligns with current industry standards.

**Tailored Websites**

[Tailored Websites](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-K3KB3DNTX5HTFDKPJB8BF54B5PSMNNDK) are designed to meet the specific needs of your client's business. Our team of developers and designers work closely with you to create a unique digital experience that truly represents your brand with advanced features, boutique services, and bespoke design elements.

We are confident in our ability to deliver these two types of services, and are eager to see how we can help local businesses in your markets succeed with these offerings.

**2. Retiring Old Website Services**

Now that we've got something new and improved to offer, we want to sunset the old products to ensure there's only one, better solution.

**As of July 19th, 2024**, partners who have not purchased/sold an 'Up To:' Website since January 2024 will no longer see these old offerings in their Marketplace.

Partners who have purchased an 'Up To:' Website in the past 6 months will continue to have access to these products **until December 1st, 2024**. After this date, these skus will be sunset for all partners.

We created this cutoff so that partners who regularly sell the Up To: Website products will continue to have access for any imminent transactions, and will have time to transition to the new offering before December 1st, 2024.

The skus that will be sunsetted include:

- Website: Up to 10 Pages (Monthly)
- Website: Up to 10 Pages (One-time)
- Website: Up to 5 Pages (Monthly)
- Website: Up to 5 Pages (One-time)
- Website: Up to 3 Pages (Monthly)
- Website: Up to 3 Pages (One-time)

**3. Major Updates to Website Support**

Website support, when to activate it, when to cancel it, and how to charge for it has been a dilemma for years, but we've come up with a solution that just makes sense.

For all Templated and Tailored Website builds, Website Support is no longer included in the cost of the website build. This also means that Website Support is no longer included or supplied for 12 months.

Instead, we are requiring website support for 3 months after we set the site live. We know that requests for edits, changes, and updates occur primarily in the first 3 months after a build is set live.

**For current activations of [Website Support](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-9f77626ea38b4e44b044382b50c5f83e):** By implementing this change, all partners who currently have [Website Support](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-9f77626ea38b4e44b044382b50c5f83e) active will also see a commitment on their Website Support service. However, if they activated it prior to August 1st, 2024, we will allow them to void this commitment.

**For new activations of [Website Support](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-9f77626ea38b4e44b044382b50c5f83e):** When a new Templated Website is purchased, [Website Support](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/MP-9f77626ea38b4e44b044382b50c5f83e) will be an additional, required product. As in, they will not be able to buy the build without the support.

**Very Important:** The activation of Website Support will occur immediately and will be put in a pending state. This means that an initial charge will be shown, but it will be held in 'pending' until the site is set live. Once the site is set live, Website Support will be approved, and the next charge will be incurred 1 month after this approval date. The first charge then, upon initial activation of the build product, will act as a type of deposit and will pay for the first month after the site is live.

We are making this change to simplify the Website Support ordering process by preventing surprise activations and interrupted support.

**Final Thoughts**

We're really proud of the new website solutions we've come up with, and we believe that our new templated and tailored websites will provide you with the options you need to help your clients create a powerful online presence. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.

Thank you for choosing our Marketing Services. We look forward to supporting your digital journey!
