## Canceling your Starter/Startup/Individual subscription

Partners on a Starter, Startup, or Individual plan are able to cancel their subscription by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdt1tIsvoyiETY0ZQLLe0vzn-xras9xJMGNgOs7eRv50Jb1pA/viewform).

Cancellations must be submitted 48 hours prior to renewal to avoid additional subscription charges and will be processed within 2 business days.

It’s important to note that after cancellation:

- Accounts with paid apps and services will continue to renew and can still be used until canceled.
- Standard products in excess of one will become billable upon renewal.
- Accounts with active billing automations will continue to bill and collect unless toggled off.
- Additional team member seats will continue to bill unless edited from Partner Center.

To cancel or downgrade a contracted subscription, speak to your Account Manager or email your request to [support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com) for further guidance.

You will continue to be charged for active products and subscriptions for the committed length of your contract terms. Refer to the [Terms of Service](https://www.vendasta.com/terms/terms-of-service/) and deactivate products to avoid any unnecessary charges.
