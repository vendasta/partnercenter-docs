# Intro to Vendasta

Use this guide to quickly get oriented with the Vendasta platform; each platform environment, how onboarding works, trial limitations, and continued learning resources.

## Platform overview

Vendasta provides an end-to-end platform that helps you scale sales, marketing, fulfillment, and operations.

### The platform has 3 environments

One for administrators and salespeople (Partner Center), one for customers (Business App), and one for fulfillment (Task Manager). Together, they empower you to provide products and services to local businesses.

### Partner Center is for your business

- Customize your branding and settings
- Manage your prospects and customers
- Set up products and services
- Build your online store
- Publish and track marketing campaigns
- Manage salespeople
- Manage billing
- Manage customers' products, services, and credentials

Admins can access Partner Center via [partners.vendasta.com](https://partners.vendasta.com/dashboard?utm_campaign=partner-onboarding&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=resource-center&utm_content=welcome-inline-link). Partner Center isn't white‑labeled, and the URL isn't customizable.

### Business App is for your customers

In Business App, your prospects and customers can:

- Receive updates about key business metrics
- Access the products they've purchased
- Browse products and services in your online store

Your customers access Business App from a URL unique to your agency (found under Accounts > Manage Users in Partner Center). The Growth and Scale plans include the ability to customize this domain.

### Task Manager is for fulfillment

Your team can:

- Update listings, respond to reviews and mentions
- Create social posts and engage with leads
- Onboard new customers and complete custom tasks

Access Task Manager at [https://task-manager.biz/login/](https://task-manager.biz/login/).
