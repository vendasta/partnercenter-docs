# Welcome to Vendasta

Welcome to the Vendasta platform! Use this guide to get oriented quickly—what the platform includes, who uses which parts, how onboarding works, trial limitations, and how to continue learning.

## Platform overview

What if you had your own branded end-to-end commerce platform that empowered you to scale sales, marketing, fulfillment, and operations better than you could ever imagine? As you watch the video below, ask yourself: how could these features accelerate my business?

### The platform has 3 environments

One for you and your salespeople, one for your customers, and one for fulfillment. Together, they empower you to provide products and services to local businesses.
