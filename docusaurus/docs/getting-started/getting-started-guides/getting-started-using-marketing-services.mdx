### Review the fulfillment forms

An important step in ensuring a quick turnaround for your fulfillment is providing a completed fulfillment form. The information in these forms help the Marketing Services teams to complete the ordered services in alignment with what you and your customer wants.

Fulfillment form information is also available in Partner Center > Marketplace > Discover Products by visiting any of the product pages. On the right, you will find a section for Required Forms and clicking into it will show you the form.

Ordering Marketing Services products is the same as [ordering any product](/getting-started/announcements/ordering-products) in the platform. It's important to know that our teams require additional information after the product has been ordered so they can successfully fulfill the service in line with what you and your customers require.

1. Go to Partner Center > Businesses > Accounts > Click on the account for which you want to place an order
2. Click Order Products
3. Select the package(s) or product(s) you wish to order
   - You may be prompted to activate additional products that are needed to fulfill services (eg. Social Marketing is needed for our team to post as part of our social posting services)
4. Click Proceed to Next Step
5. Review and fill in any contact information
6. Click Next
7. Review and Purchase

After completing the purchase, you will be presented with a [fulfillment form](/getting-started/getting-started-guides/marketing-services-fulfillment-forms). This form contains necessary details to be completed so that Marketing Services teams can successfully complete the work that has been purchased.

Check out this video for full details on inputting information, sharing, and submitting a fulfillment form.

### Ordering - Website Services

Website services in particular require a lot of information about a business in order to successfully create their website and web copy with expedient turnaround times. Check out our [website ordering guide](https://marketing-services.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19127162749463) and the video below for more info.

:::note
The following video showcases an older workflow from before the implementation of fulfillment forms. The workflow is very similar, with the exception that the ability to upload a content form pdf comes *after* the purchase.

### Ordering - Digital Ads

When ordering Digital Ads, you will be required to choose the ad spend for the campaign. This is the amount specific to the ad spend and then the system will calculate the ad management fee for you. You will be prompted to do this between steps 4 and 5 in the workflow noted above.

Note that the ad spend, management fee, and setup fees are all a part of the wholesale cost.

## Attend the pre-launch call (if applicable)

Almost all services include a pre-launch call, often called an onboarding call, to welcome the customer, go through a content questionnaire, and set expectations for the services. Check out [this article](https://marketing-services.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19299630230423-Expectations-by-Service-within-Marketing-Services) to see which services receive a pre-launch call.

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: '0'}}>
  <iframe style={{position: 'absolute', top: '0', left: '0', width: '100%', height: '100%'}} src="https://www.loom.com/embed/bfe981ad72fc4c6e8c5689ccb0b5af9f?sid=51bdebe0-f25c-41ba-be8d-2a3cd2417bc4" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>

Our team will choose a time for this call and send an invite to any contacts listed at the time of order (these contacts will also be given a link to reschedule if necessary as part of the invite). The call will happen over a Google meet, the agent from Marketing Services typically does this with camera off to preserve white label, and will use the call to align the customer expectations and needs from the service with fulfillment processes.

This call is also important to ensure that we have all of the necessary access and connections that we need.

## Track the progress of fulfillment

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: '0'}}>
  <iframe style={{position: 'absolute', top: '0', left: '0', width: '100%', height: '100%'}} src="https://www.loom.com/embed/43b9b517883a4e71a1d7f9c33dfae858" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>

You, your sales team, and your customers can keep an eye on the progress of fulfillment for the services you have ordered.

The easiest way to access this information is through Business App > Projects.

![Projects view](./img/marketing-services/projects-view.jpg)

There is also a Projects card found in the account under Partner Center > Accounts > Manage Accounts.

![Projects card](./img/marketing-services/projects-card.jpg)

Your salespeople can view this information on the account page under Fulfillment projects.

![Fulfillment projects](./img/marketing-services/fulfillment-projects.jpg)

You can also find information by going into Task Manager > Projects. But note that some of this information may be "grayed out" or inaccessible because the project is being completed in Marketing Service's Task Manager account and a read-only version is being shared with you.
