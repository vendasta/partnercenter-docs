# Canceling your Starter/Startup/Individual Subscription

Partners on a **Starter, Startup, or Individual** plan are able to cancel their subscription by filling out **[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdt1tIsvoyiETY0ZQLLe0vzn-xras9xJMGNgOs7eRv50Jb1pA/viewform)**.

Cancellations must be submitted 48 hours prior to renewal to avoid additional subscription charges and will be processed within 2 business days.

**It's important to note that after cancellation:**

- Accounts with paid apps & services will continue to renew and can still be used until cancelled.
- Standard products in excess of one will become billable upon renewal.
- Accounts with active billing automations will continue to bill and collect unless toggled off.
- Additional team member seats will continue to bill unless edited from Partner Center.

**To cancel or downgrade a contracted subscription, speak to your Account Manager or email your request to [support@vendasta.com](mailto:support@vendasta.com) for further guidance.**

You will continue to be charged for active products and subscriptions for the committed length of your contract terms. Refer to the**[Terms of Service](https://www.vendasta.com/terms/terms-of-service/)** and **deactivate products** to avoid any unnecessary charges.
