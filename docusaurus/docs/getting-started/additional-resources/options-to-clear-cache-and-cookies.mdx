# Options to clear cache and cookies

When you're having an issue with any internal or external platform, one of the most common troubleshooting suggestions is to clear your cache and cookies. While this may sound like the web equivalent of "try turning it on and off again," clearing out your cache and cookies is not only a key troubleshooting step, but in many cases, it will solve your problem altogether!

### **But what is your cache, and why should you clear it?**

Browsers use cookies (files containing user data) placed in your computer's cache (temporary data storage space) to store website information on your computer, so web pages and components can load quickly. Most platforms and vendors including Google, Microsoft, and Vendasta use this ability to deliver the best possible performance for end-users.

To keep things simple... and super fast here are some great ways to clear your cache and cookies. 

### **Browser Guides**

Browsers are constantly updating themselves, so to ensure you're getting the latest information, use the following links to view the current browser-specific methods for clearing your cache and cookies:

- [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21412?locale=en_US)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache)
- [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-delete-browsing-history-internet-explorer#ie=ie-11)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
- [Opera](http://help.opera.com/Windows/12.10/en/cache.html)

### **Using Extensions**

While the methods described in the links above are commonly used, adding an extension can make the process quick and easy. The information below can minimize the hassle of clearing your cache and cookies, as it will only update the cookies for the page you have opened at the time. Click the links to download the available extension.

**Chrome: [Clear Session](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-session/maejjihldgmkjlfmgpgoebepjchengka)**

This extension retains your data and login information from every web location where you are signed in. This means you won't have to sign in again to every website after clearing the cache.

You can streamline this extension by setting keyboard shortcuts for actions. To find the extension, go to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome's address bar to open up the Extensions page. At the very bottom of the page, you'll see a **Keyboard Shortcuts** option. Add your key combination, and never have to click or deal with a menu again.

**Firefox: [Clear Site Cache](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clear-site-cache/)**

The Firefox extension is similar to Chrome's and contains the same functionality.

**Internet Explorer**

Unfortunately, Internet Explorer does not have an add-on that removes cookies on a per-site basis.
