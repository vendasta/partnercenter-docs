# Partner Center Omni-Search

Omni-Search allows Partner Center admins to quickly and easily find any business that they manage and impersonate any of their clients or salespeople â€” all at the press of a button.

Partner Center admins can use hotkeys to find and impersonate a business or salesperson, or to view the account details of a specific business.

### **How does Omni-Search work?**

Press [**/**] (forward-slash key) anywhere in Partner Center to immediately open the Omni-Search menu. Typing [**B**] allows the user to enter the name of a business and immediately view their account details page. Typing [**U**] allows the user to search for and impersonate a given business user or salesperson.

Press [**Tab**] to move through the results, and select a result by pressing [**Enter**].
