# Partner Troubleshooting Guide

This space contains guides which will aid you in troubleshooting some issues you may possibly encounter while working in the platform. These guides should help you determine if an issue you are facing can be resolved before they are considered technical issues which require escalation to the Vendasta Support team.

Please note there is no guarantee these actions will resolve your issue so if after troubleshooting you still experience issues please submit a ticket to support@vendasta.com

### **When to contact Marketing Support vs Support on-Demand**

**Explanation:**

Send a ticket to Support on-Demand if you are unsure where the best place to submit the ticket is, we will make sure it gets where it needs to be. however, there are some challenges when we get a ticket for Marketing Services. Marketing Services does not use the same system that Support on-Demand uses, this means that we can't just send the ticket to them to action. This can cause delays and loss of information in the transfer.

**Issue:**

Unsure who to contact about a Marketing Services related issue or question.

**Fix:**

1. Is this an error with the platform/product?
   - **support@vendasta.com**
2. Does this involve making changes to work Marketing Services is currently doing or will be doing in the future?
   - **support@yourdigitalagents.com**
3. Is there a reporting error or an error message blocking work, or does this feel like a bug?
   - **support@vendasta.com**
4. Is this communication/feedback/questions for the Marketing Services teams?
   - **support@yourdigitalagents.com**


### **Submitting a Support Ticket**

**Explanation:**

The more applicable information we have, the better our investigation will be, the fewer times we will have to reach out to you or the partner, and the quicker we can find an answer/escalate the problem. You know your partners and their processes and internal lingo much better than the Support Agents, we rely on you to relay the applicable information.

**Issue:**
Unsure on what to include in a Support on-Demand support request.

**Fix:**

For best results, please include the following information in the body of the ticket or request:

1. Partner ID
2. Account Group ID (if applicable)
3. User or team member affected (if applicable)
4. Replication Steps
5. Screenshots (or video) of error messages

These best practices are highly recommended when submitting a ticket to support.
