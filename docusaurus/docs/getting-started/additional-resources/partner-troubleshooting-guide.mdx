# Partner Troubleshooting Guide

This space contains guides which will aid you in troubleshooting some issues you may possibly encounter while working in the platform. These guides should help you determine if an issue you are facing can be resolved before they are considered technical issues which require escalation to the Vendasta Support team.

Please note there is no guarantee these actions will resolve your issue so if after troubleshooting you still experience issues please submit a ticket to support@vendasta.com

### **When to contact Marketing Support vs Support on-Demand**

**Explanation:**

Send a ticket to Support on-Demand if you are unsure where the best place to submit the ticket is, we will make sure it gets where it needs to be. however, there are some challenges when we get a ticket for Marketing Services. Marketing Services does not use the same system that Support on-Demand uses, this means that we can't just send the ticket to them to action. This can cause delays and loss of information in the transfer.

**Issue:**

Unsure who to contact about a Marketing Services related issue or question.

**Fix:**

1. Is this an error with the platform/product?
   - **support@vendasta.com**
2. Does this involve making changes to work Marketing Services is currently doing or will be doing in the future?
   - **support@yourdigitalagents.com**
3. Is there a reporting error or an error message blocking work, or does this feel like a bug?
   - **support@vendasta.com**
4. Is this communication/feedback/questions for the Marketing Services teams?
   - **support@yourdigitalagents.com**


### **Submitting a Support Ticket**

**Explanation:**

The more applicable information we have, the better our investigation will be, the fewer times we will have to reach out to you or the partner, and the quicker we can find an answer/escalate the problem. You know your partners and their processes and internal lingo much better than the Support Agents, we rely on you to relay the applicable information.

**Issue:**
Unsure on what to include in a Support on-Demand support request.

**Fix:**

For best results, please include the following information in the body of the ticket or request:

1. Partner ID
2. Account Group ID (if applicable)
3. User or team member affected (if applicable)
4. Replication Steps
5. Screenshots (or video) of error messages

These best practices are highly recommended when submitting a ticket to support.

## Clear cache and cookies

When you're having an issue with any internal or external platform, one of the most common troubleshooting suggestions is to clear your cache and cookies. While this may sound like the web equivalent of "try turning it on and off again," clearing out your cache and cookies is not only a key troubleshooting step, but in many cases, it will solve your problem altogether.

## Get your network (HAR) file

If you cannot access areas of the platform while others can, your network settings may be blocking specific domains. Our Technical Support Team may request a Network (HAR) file to diagnose these issues.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the login page on Business/Partner Center (or the area where you're having issues). Right‑click the page and select "Inspect."
2. In the console, select the "Network" tab, check "Preserve log," then reproduce the action. You should see entries populate.
3. With the network panel open, refresh the page and attempt the action again (if applicable).
4. Right‑click any line in the network list and select "Save all as HAR with content." Save the file.
5. Email the file to Support on Demand upon request. If the file is larger than 35 MB, share via Google Drive.

### Retrieve your HAR file from Safari

In Safari, open the menu bar and select Safari > Preferences > Advanced. Enable "Show Develop menu in menu bar."

Then, right‑click > Inspect Element > Network > check Preserve Log > refresh page > right‑click any lines that appear > select Save HAR.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>Why are my emails going to spam for Gmail accounts?</summary>

Gmail's spam filtering is client‑specific and proprietary. Common triggers include links in footers or links to pages that collect user information. Try removing non‑essential links from templates and review Gmail's guidelines for avoiding spam filtering.
