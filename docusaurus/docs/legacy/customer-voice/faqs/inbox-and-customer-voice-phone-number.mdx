**_Note:_ As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.**

If your client has sent SMS review requests through Customer Voice Pro prior to sending their first Inbox message, the phone number will be the same.

However, if your client uses the Business app Inbox before activating or sending any SMS review requests through Customer Voice Pro, the numbers will be different.
