:::caution Note
As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.
:::

The Customer Voice product is an independent product but works better when associated with other products on the platform.

The following products can be associated with Customer Voice:

1. **Local SEO**: This product is needed for the client to have a 'My Listing' page where reviews can be collected and managed with the help of the customer voice template.

2. **Reputation Management**: This product speaks to Customer Voice, especially the review sources. For instance, if you have the Reputation Management Standard product, the listing URLs for Facebook and Google are automatically pulled from Reputation Management and synced to Customer Voice and you will not be required to add the URLs manually.

   (*Note: The Listings must be present in Reputation Management for this to happen*).

   With Reputation Management Pro, you're able to add more review sources.
