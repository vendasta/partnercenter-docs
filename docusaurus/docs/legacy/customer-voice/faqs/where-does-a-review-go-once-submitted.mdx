:::note
As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.
:::

Where reviews appear depends on your **Default Review Template** OR the **Template you selected when sending out a review request.**

- If you've selected **My Preferred Sites** (Customer Voice > Templates), your reviews will appear directly on the sites you've directed users to. The status in Customer Voice > Customers will update to either 'Bounced,' 'Sent,' 'Clicked,' or 'Opened.'
- If you've selected **My Listing**, reviews will appear on My Listing, a page created automatically by Local SEO. The status will update in Customer Voice > Customers to "Review Completed."

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>

:::info
The "Contact Us" button in the default review template takes the customer to the "My Listing" page, and the icons for your Preferred review sites take you directly to the site (ex: Google) to leave a review.
