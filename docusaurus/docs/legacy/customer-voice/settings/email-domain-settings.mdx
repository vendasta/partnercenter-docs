:::caution Legacy Product
As of February 21st, 2025, Customer Voice has become a legacy Vendasta product. Start using [Reputation Management Premium](https://partners.vendasta.com/marketplace/products/RM) to automatically collect reviews and NPS via email and SMS.
:::

A frequently asked question in Customer Voice is "Why are the review requests going out from @smblogin.com and how can I modify it to display/use my email address?"

For instance:

![Email example showing noreply+businessname@smblogin.com](/img/legacy-customer-voice/email-example.png)

For Customer Voice Standard accounts, emails will come from the email noreply+businessname@smblogin.com. The client's business name will be automatically substituted for "businessname." Clients may customize their "sent-from" email domain with **Customer Voice Pro**. Do this by clicking "Edit Send from email" when editing an email template.

After upgrading to the Pro edition, the setting can be configured in the **Business App > Settings > Email Configuration:**

To edit send from information, domain validation is not required. You can just change the send from information to be able to send review requests from that email ID.
