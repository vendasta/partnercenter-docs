### What is the email signature widget?

The widget gives Customer Voice users a personalized email signature ready to copy and paste into their email signature settings. The signature prompts its receiver to leave a review for the business through a simple call to action: "How did we do? Click to rate your experience of [business name]".

### Why is the email signature widget important?

Email is one of the most efficient ways for companies to communicate with their customers. Tacking on an email signature asking for a review is a simple and non-invasive way to ask for customer feedback.

This feature will allow businesses to proactively ask for customer reviews through every email they send out to their customers.

### How will the email signature widget work?

This new feature is available to all users of Customer Voice Standard and Pro.

- Go to **Customer Voice** > **Tools** > **Widgets**
- **Email Signature Widget:** Select where you would like to collect reviews by selecting **My Listing** or **Preferred Sources**
- Click **Copy email signature widget**
- Paste into the email signature of your email-sending platform (i.e. Gmail). The widget will automatically pull the business name into the signature as shown below.
