### **Why are SMS Performance Metrics Important?**

Business owners need a way to visualize the effectiveness of SMS messages sent in Customer Voice. SMS reporting will include: the number of SMS messages sent and what percentage have been clicked on (click-through rate).

_Note: Open rate_ is not available for SMS-type messages.

These metrics are important to help businesses understand the value of sending SMS messages and their effectiveness.

### **How do SMS Performance Metrics work?**

Go to **Customer Voice Pro** (account must have an SMS add-on) > **Overview**.

Here's what you can expect from the new metrics:

  - _Note:_ Open rate is for email only
- The ability to filter by a specific date range
